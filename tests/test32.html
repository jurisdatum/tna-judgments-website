                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This is an appeal brought with the permission of Swift J against his order of Friday,&nbsp;10&nbsp;June&nbsp;2022,
                     refusing interim relief, in particular to prevent the removal of the individual claimants
                     from the United Kingdom ("UK") to Rwanda, pursuant to the well-known scheme which
                     has been agreed between the Governments of the two countries.  The reason for the
                     urgency in the case is that&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight is due to take place on the evening of tomorrow,&nbsp;14&nbsp;June,
                     with the first group of individuals who are to be removed to Rwanda.  At one time
                     there were&nbsp;37&nbsp;people to be removed on that flight but, at the hearing this morning
                     we were informed that there are&nbsp;11.  They include the Fifth Appellant but no longer
                     include the Fourth.  They were the Ninth and Tenth Claimants in the High Court proceedings.

                     hard work, in particular over the weekend, which has enabled this hearing to take
                     place today speedily and efficiently.  In particular we are grateful to Mr&nbsp;Raza Husain
                     QC, who made oral submissions for the Appellants, Ms&nbsp;Laura Dubinsky QC, who made submissions
                     for the Intervener, the UNHCR, and Mr&nbsp;Rory Dunlop QC, who made submissions for the
                     Respondent.

                     transcript of the judgment below.  The Court and the parties have, however, been provided
                     with&nbsp;a&nbsp;note of his judgment by the judge, for which we are grateful.  The parties
                     have had the opportunity to draw our attention to any errors or deficiencies that
                     there may have been in that note but none has been suggested that is material.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Before we address the specific issues which arise on this appeal, we should emphasise
                     certain fundamentals about our system of justice.  While the underlying issues concerning
                     removal of some asylum claimants to Rwanda are the subject of much public interest
                     and ethical and political controversy, the courts cannot enter those debates.  The
                     merits of the underlying policy are not&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter for the courts: the Government is
                     accountable to Parliament for the merits of its policies.  The courts have the important,
                     but limited, function of deciding only whether governmental action is lawful or not.
                     Furthermore, the question of the lawfulness of the scheme is not before us today and
                     will be considered by the High Court in July.  
                  </p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Moreover, as will become apparent, the role of this Court is not the same as the role
                     of the High Court.  We do not sit to hear the case again or to substitute our own
                     views for that of the judge.  As is common ground, our role, as an appellate court,
                     is&nbsp;a&nbsp;more limited one, especially as the decision which the judge took to refuse interim
                     relief was one in which he was exercising&nbsp;a&nbsp;discretion.  In particular, we shall have
                     to consider whether the judge erred in principle and, even if he did not, whether
                     his decision was one which was not reasonably open to him on the material before him.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The First Appellant, which was the Fifth Claimant below, the Public and Commercial
                     Services Union ("PCSU"), is the largest trade union representing civil servants and
                     represents around&nbsp;80&nbsp;per cent of Border Force Officials who are charged with implementing
                     the scheme.  The Second and Third Appellants, who were the Sixth and Seventh Claimants
                     below, are both charities.  Detention Action provides support to people in immigration
                     detention and campaigns for detention reform; it is interested in this case because
                     the scheme envisages that detention powers will be used to hold persons pending their
                     removal to Rwanda.  Care&nbsp;4&nbsp;Calais provides frontline humanitarian support to refugees.

                           provisions about the removal of persons claiming asylum to 'countries known to protect
                           refugees and respect human rights'.  Absent Schedule&nbsp;3, the operative provision is
                           section&nbsp;77&nbsp;of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act&nbsp;2002&nbsp;("the&nbsp;2002&nbsp;Act"). 
                           That prevents the removal from the United Kingdom of&nbsp;a&nbsp;person who has an asylum claim
                           pending.  Schedule&nbsp;3&nbsp;to the&nbsp;2004&nbsp;Act contains four distinct schemes that provide exceptions
                           to the default provision in section&nbsp;77&nbsp;of the&nbsp;2002&nbsp;Act.  Persons who have made asylum
                           claims that have yet to be determined may be removed under any of these exceptions.
                           The premise of these exceptions is that the person concerned will then be able to
                           pursue an asylum claim in the country to which he has been removed.

                           on the list of states.  Parts Three and Four of Schedule&nbsp;3&nbsp;permit the Secretary of
                           State to make orders specifying states.  If an order is made, the state concerned

                           the Secretary of State has so certified, paragraph&nbsp;18&nbsp;of Schedule&nbsp;3&nbsp;disapplies section&nbsp;77&nbsp;of

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By the time of the hearing, the application for interim relief sought to prevent the
                     Fourth and Fifth Appellants being removed to Rwanda pending the final hearing of the
                     proceedings and an order to prevent the Secretary of State from removing any person,
                     who has made an asylum claim, without their consent to Rwanda until the final hearing
                     of the claim.  Importantly, the judge considered that the legality of the individual
                     removal decisions was the operative matters for these proceedings, not the general
                     decision of the Secretary of State to remove asylum claimants to Rwanda (see paragraphs&nbsp;5&nbsp;to&nbsp;13&nbsp;of
                     his judgment, in particular the conclusion at paragraph&nbsp;9).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The judge considered that there was&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious issue to be tried on grounds&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3&nbsp;and&nbsp;5.
                     Accordingly, he went on to consider whether the balance of convenience for an interim
                     period, unlikely to extend far beyond July&nbsp;2022, favoured or did not favour the grant
                     of interim relief and held that it favoured neither the granting of the generic order
                     sought against all removals without consent to Rwanda nor an order preventing the
                     removal of the individual claimants.  The judge recognised that removal to Rwanda
                     would be "arduous" and "distressing" for the individual claimants and that material
                     matters of personal prejudice to each claimant would arise on removal.  In parentheses,
                     we should observe that the note of the judgment taken by those acting for the Appellants
                     recorded that the judge used the word "onerous" but, as Mr&nbsp;Husain rightly acknowledged,
                     there is no material difference between the words "arduous" and "onerous" in this
                     context.  However, the judge held that any prejudice to the claimants was outweighed
                     by the prejudice which an order preventing removals would cause to the public interest
                     in the Secretary of State being able to implement immigration control decisions, even
                     for&nbsp;a&nbsp;short interim period.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The judge observed at paragraph&nbsp;9&nbsp;that each individual claimant in the case had been
                     subject to&nbsp;a&nbsp;discrete decision taken under the&nbsp;2004&nbsp;Act and under the Immigration
                     Rules, and that there was no single, generic decision that could be the target of
                     an application for judicial review.  The judge set out his reasoning on this point
                     by close reference to the relevant statutory provisions at paragraphs&nbsp;10&nbsp;to&nbsp;13&nbsp;of
                     his judgment with the conclusion that the premise for the operation of the policy
                     on removal to Rwanda was, first, that the person falls within one or other of the
                     categories specified at paragraph&nbsp;345A of the Immigration Rules, most likely subparagraph
                     (iii)(b), and, second, that being so, Rwanda is&nbsp;a&nbsp;safe country that agrees to&nbsp;a&nbsp;person's
                     entry for the purposes of paragraph&nbsp;345C of the Rules.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At paragraph&nbsp;14&nbsp;the judge directed himself to the well-known test for applications
                     for interim relief.  The two questions were whether the Claimants' grounds of challenge
                     gave rise to one or more serious triable issues and, if they did, that the grant of
                     relief will depend on the "balance of convenience", which he chose to describe more
                     precisely as "which course of action pending the final hearing of the claim for judicial
                     review gives rise to the least risk of prejudice if it turns out to be the wrong course
                     of action."  In assessing what the judge called "the balance of prejudice" at paragraph&nbsp;15,
                     he said that he was bound to take account of the interests of the Fourth and Fifth
                     Appellants and the general public interest that&nbsp;a&nbsp;public authority be permitted to
                     apply&nbsp;a&nbsp;policy or continue to act to exercise its statutory powers when acting in

                     and UNHCR disclosed during the hearing.  The judge considered these in light of the
                     Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") and Notes Verbales before the court as he considered

                     be deterring people from making dangerous journeys to the UK to claim asylum which
                     are facilitated by criminal smugglers.  The judge accepted that this public interest

                     that the balance of convenience did not favour the grant of relief.  First, the judge

                     before the judge and in tension with the finding that ground&nbsp;1&nbsp;disclosed&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious

                     of Rwanda would follow the terms of the MOU and Notes Verbales as the test was one
                     of being sure and the judge cannot have been sure as there is no sound objective basis

                     and dignity, the risk of arbitrary detention in Rwanda if asylum seekers protest against

                     where there is no evidence of the policy's deterrent effect and serious doubts have

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><u>Ground&nbsp;3&nbsp;</u>on this appeal is shorter and concerns the conclusion that general interim relief
                     was inappropriate as no ground raised&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious triable issue cutting across all individual
                     removal decisions.  Mr&nbsp;Husain submits that the judge made&nbsp;a&nbsp;fundamental legal error
                     in holding that&nbsp;a&nbsp;generally applicable assessment or decision, which judicial review
                     ground&nbsp;1&nbsp;targets, cannot be challenged by way of judicial review when not "operative"
                     in an individual's case.  If correct, then it would follow that policies would not
                     be amenable to judicial review at all.  Moreover, Mr&nbsp;Husain argues that the Secretary
                     of State's assessment has been relied on heavily in individual decisions and so any
                     public law error in that decision vitiates the individual removal decisions which
                     rely on it.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr&nbsp;Husain relies on his previous submissions as to why general interim relief is appropriate
                     and highlights three particular points before this Court.  First, any issue taken
                     as to the standing of the First to Third Appellants is not an issue at this hearing.
                     Second, the evidence on irremediable harm in this case applies "across the board"
                     to every decision made pursuant to the scheme and is, in Mr&nbsp;Husain's submission, enough
                     to show&nbsp;a&nbsp;real risk of Article&nbsp;3&nbsp;harm.  Potential further prejudice to groups not
                     before the Court, who may be gay or disabled, makes the case even more compelling.
                     Third, the type of general interim relief order sought is one commonly made in charter
                     flight cases and Mr&nbsp;Husain relies on&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of examples of such orders which the
                     Court has made in other unrelated cases.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr&nbsp;Husain also notes that by the day of the hearing in the Court of Appeal, matters
                     have moved on and there is now no time for other individuals to bring applications
                     before the Court.  This, he says, favours the grant of general interim relief in favour
                     of all individuals who have not consented to their removal to Rwanda.  At the hearing
                     before us Mr&nbsp;Husain made it clear that his submission is confined to all the&nbsp;11&nbsp;people
                     who are due to be removed on tomorrow's flight and does not include anyone who may
                     be removed to Rwanda in the next few weeks before the substantive hearing in the High
                     Court.  Nevertheless, as Mr&nbsp;Dunlop observed on behalf of the Respondent, it would
                     be unrealistic to think that, if this Court grants generic interim relief in relation
                     to the flight tomorrow, other flights could take place before the High Court hearing.

                     views concerning factual matters within its remit and the legal standards applicable
                     under the Refugee Convention are owed great respect.  This respect is&nbsp;a&nbsp;product of
                     the UNHCR's supervisory responsibilities, the duty of member states under the Refugee
                     Convention to co-operate with it, and its unique experience and expertise as recognised
                     by the courts.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In short, the UNHCR's submission is that the flight on&nbsp;14&nbsp;June&nbsp;2022&nbsp;to Rwanda should
                     not proceed and, more generally, removals to Rwanda under the agreement between the
                     UK and Rwanda should be suspended.  The reason for this position most relevant to
                     these interim relief proceedings is the UNHCR's serious concerns about Rwanda's capacity
                     to make fair refugee status determination decisions adequate to protect from indirect
                     <i>refoulement. </i></p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In its written submissions, the UNHCR draws the Court's attention to&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of relevant
                     factual matters.  Ms&nbsp;Dubinsky highlights that the vast majority of the Rwandan Government's
                     decision-making on refugee claims has been of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<i>prima facie </i>kind concerning objective circumstances in&nbsp;a&nbsp;limited number of nearby countries of
                     origin and that case-by-case determination is nascent (there is said to be only one
                     eligibility officer in Rwanda assessing all such claims).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Ms&nbsp;Dubinsky also highlights that when the Secretary of State and the UNHCR met in
                     Kigali in March&nbsp;2022, the UNHCR was not informed that the UK Government was contemplating&nbsp;a&nbsp;process
                     of removing asylum seekers to Rwanda and, therefore, did not elicit the UNHCR's views
                     on this proposal.  Further, the Secretary of State then omitted from the published
                     policy documents concerns which the UNHCR had raised about the proposals in meetings
                     held in the UK and Kigali in April&nbsp;2022.  The substance of those concerns are set
                     out at paragraphs&nbsp;14&nbsp;and&nbsp;15&nbsp;of the UNHCR's written submissions before this Court.

                     letters issued by the Secretary of State which contained incorrect statements about
                     the UNHCR's involvement in the agreement with Rwanda, its role in oversight and claims
                     that the UNHCR had <i>not</i> expressed substantial concerns.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Addressing the first ground of appeal, Ms&nbsp;Dubinsky reiterates the submissions made
                     before the judge that the UNHCR warns that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real risk of indirect <i>refoulement</i> if asylum seekers are removed from the UK to Rwanda.  The UNHCR has concerns about
                     the fairness and capacity of the refugee status determination process which cannot
                     be rectified at speed.  Ms&nbsp;Dubinsky also submits that persons relocated to Rwanda
                     may be at risk of detention and treatment not in accordance with international standards
                     should they protest against their conditions after arrival.

                     regard to the UNHCR's risk assessment.  Ms&nbsp;Dubinsky also submits that the MOU and
                     Notes Verbales do not demonstrate when or how&nbsp;a&nbsp;systemic improvement process will
                     achieve&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant change to the present situation on the ground in Rwanda and
                     the judge should not have concluded that warnings about fairness and capacity were
                     inapplicable or mitigated by these documents.  Further, the intentions expressed in
                     the documents do not remove the real risk of what, the UNHCR submits, are three distinct
                     forms of <i>refoulement</i>: pre-emptory <i>refoulement</i>, constructive <i>refoulement </i>or, as she put it at the hearing before us <i>de facto refoulement</i>, and <i>de jure</i> <i>refoulement</i>.

                     for example to interpreters, trained decision-makers and the like in Rwanda.  We have

                     seekers and to achieve that aim the Secretary of State sought&nbsp;a&nbsp;partnership with another

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In relation to the first ground of appeal, Mr&nbsp;Dunlop advances five "answers" to the
                     alleged errors in the judge's conclusions about the first stage of the judge's assessment
                     on the serious issues to be tried.  First, he submits that this ground does not identify
                     any error of principle.  It is in essence&nbsp;a&nbsp;submission that the judge should have
                     given greater weight to the likelihood of the claim succeeding as it was "compelling".
                     Any difference between the judge's assessment that there was&nbsp;a&nbsp;serious issue and the
                     contentions about&nbsp;a&nbsp;compelling case are not material.  In any event, this Court should
                     not, Mr&nbsp;Dunlop argues, substitute its views on the strengths of the grounds of the
                     claim.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Secondly, Mr&nbsp;Dunlop contends that the Appellants are wrong to submit that the Secretary
                     of State and the judgment have no answer to ground&nbsp;1&nbsp;of the claim or the concerns
                     raised by the UNHCR.  For example, later material from the UNHCR can be taken into
                     account by officials making case-by-case decisions and the Secretary of State is well-placed
                     to assess the likelihood of Rwanda complying with the Notes Verbales.  Whether those
                     Notes Verbales provide&nbsp;a&nbsp;sufficient answer is an issue for the substantive hearing
                     where the Secretary of State intends to submit evidence.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thirdly, given that the case turned on the balance of convenience, the judge's observations
                     on the weaker grounds were not material.  At the hearing, Mr&nbsp;Dunlop reminded us that
                     what matters is that the judge acknowledged that, if there were one or more serious
                     issues to be tried, then he should go on to consider the balance of convenience test.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourthly, the judge was correct, for the reasons he gave, to consider the ground&nbsp;4&nbsp;<i>ultra vires</i> argument to be unsustainable but, even if he was in error, this had made no difference
                     to his conclusion on interim relief.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr&nbsp;Dunlop submits that the Appellants' arguments on the second ground of appeal disclose
                     no error of principle concerning the balance of convenience and are an attempt to
                     re-argue the case.  The first error highlighted about the overall strength of the
                     case adds nothing to ground&nbsp;1.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr&nbsp;Dunlop submits that the second alleged error concerning <i>refoulement</i> has no merit.  It amounts to&nbsp;a&nbsp;challenge to&nbsp;a&nbsp;factual assessment by the judge on
                     the evidence and was not irrational or "plainly wrong".  Mr&nbsp;Dunlop also contends that
                     the UNHCR's evidence was not, as the Appellants submit, "overwhelming" and that the
                     judge was correct to identify that the very purpose of the MOU was for transferred
                     individuals to have their asylum claims considered <i>in</i> Rwanda.  Moreover, there is no tension between the conclusions on the interim risk
                     of <i>refoulement</i> and ground&nbsp;1&nbsp;of the claim.  Finally, the Appellants' submission on the weight that
                     should be afforded to the minutes of the&nbsp;25&nbsp;April&nbsp;2022&nbsp;meeting cannot found&nbsp;a&nbsp;ground
                     of appeal.

                     Mr&nbsp;Dunlop as an attempt to convert&nbsp;a&nbsp;statement of what "usually" happens in cases
                     allegedly direct <i>refoulement</i> into&nbsp;a&nbsp;universal principle encompassing indirect <i>refoulement</i>.  Mr&nbsp;Dunlop relies on the judge's explanation for why the balance of convenience
                     was different in this case arising from the MOU and the short period until the substantive
                     hearing of the claim.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to the fifth error relating to the MOU assurances, Mr&nbsp;Dunlop submits that the judge
                     did not need to be "sure" that the MOU would be followed.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Sixth, Mr&nbsp;Dunlop submits that the Appellants do not identify any "mandatory relevant
                     factors" which the judge failed to take into account in conducting the exercise. 
                     The judge had regard to the impact of removal on the individual claimants and did
                     not need to refer expressly to potential costs to the taxpayer and the like.  Mr&nbsp;Dunlop
                     also highlights that it was for the Secretary of State to assess whether the public
                     interest in starting to enforce&nbsp;a&nbsp;policy justifies the risk of additional cost or
                     administrative inconvenience if the policy is later successfully challenged.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The seventh error advanced is another point about weight which Mr&nbsp;Dunlop submits also
                     cannot found&nbsp;a&nbsp;ground of appeal.  Importantly, the judge was entitled to give weight
                     to the Secretary of State's assessment that the policy served the public interest
                     identified whether or not there was evidence that the policy had started to work.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr&nbsp;Dunlop submits that ground&nbsp;3&nbsp;on the appeal which concerns the terms of relief,
                     only survives if the Appellants succeed on grounds&nbsp;1&nbsp;and&nbsp;2, but should in any event
                     fail as there was indeed&nbsp;a&nbsp;"mismatch" between the grounds of claim advanced and the
                     general relief sought.  The judge was correct to point out that the premise that an
                     error in the general assessment of Rwanda would vitiate all decisions was wrong for
                     the reasons given at paragraph&nbsp;28.  Mr&nbsp;Dunlop notes that, for example, an official
                     making&nbsp;a&nbsp;case-by-case decision might make&nbsp;a&nbsp;lawful decision notwithstanding flaws
                     in the assessment.

                     for other individuals subject to removal directions to "get into Court" and that the
                     judge considered correctly that individual decisions about interim relief could be
                     taken.  Finally, Mr&nbsp;Dunlop also contends that the examples of other generic orders
                     relied on by the Appellants do not begin to demonstrate that in this context the judge
                     was obliged to make the generic order sought.

                     or, as it has been expressed in some of the authorities, the balance of justice or
                     the relative risk of injustice.  The risk arises from the inevitable fact that&nbsp;a&nbsp;court
                     cannot deal with the final merits of litigation early on and yet it may be necessary
                     to grant&nbsp;a&nbsp;remedy in the meantime while the parties prepare their cases.  It may turn
                     out at the end of the day that the court has granted or refused&nbsp;a&nbsp;remedy which&nbsp;a&nbsp;party
                     was or was not entitled to.

                           the judge was wrong to make the order that he did.  I do not consider that these alleged

                           court to intervene.  Even where&nbsp;a&nbsp;trial judge evaluates evidence given in writing
                           without the benefit of live evidence an appeal court should generally respect his
                           evaluation, (see <i>DB v The Chief Constable for Northern Ireland</i> … at paragraph [80]).  This applies all the more strongly where the remedy that the

                     were commenced on&nbsp;8&nbsp;June.  In view of the urgency it has not been possible for the
                     usual steps to be taken, for example, the filing of summary grounds of resistance.
                     The judge ordered there to be&nbsp;a&nbsp;rolled-up hearing before the end of July, by which
                     time the Respondent will have had the opportunity to file detailed evidence.  It is

                     Mr&nbsp;Husain submitted in his reply before us that public law grounds are inherently

                     is shown only parts of the evidence but, in any event, it is not the function of this

                     the present case turned.  As we have said, in our view, the judge conducted that balancing
                     exercise in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that cannot be impugned by this Court on appeal.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The starting point for the judge’s assessment was that the interim period would be
                     relatively short, about six or seven weeks, until around the end of July.  He was
                     right to take that view.  We do not accept the submission that the judge was obliged
                     to take into account the possibility of appeals and further delay after the judgment
                     of the High Court has been given after the substantive hearing.  The hypothesis for
                     the Appellants' case must be that they will succeed at the substantive hearing.  On
                     that basis, as the judge noted, the individual claimant would, on his own case, be
                     entitled to be returned to the UK.  If there were then an appeal, as the judge observed,
                     it would be&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter for the appellate court to determine what the next steps should
                     be, for example whether any interim relief should be granted pending an appeal.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Given therefore that the interim period would be relatively short, the judge was entitled
                     to take the view that it was unlikely that the individual claimants before him would
                     be improperly returned to another state by the Rwandan authorities in that timeframe.
                     To suggest otherwise is indeed, as the judge noted, speculative.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Furthermore, in that context, the judge was entitled to give weight to the MOU and
                     Notes Verbales.  They may not be legally enforceable, even as&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of international
                     law, but they are formal agreements between sovereign states.  The UK will expect
                     Rwanda to comply with them and the Rwandan authorities will know that their conduct
                     will be under scrutiny in the particular context of people who have been removed there
                     by the UK pursuant to the arrangements between the two countries.  The judge did not
                     need to be sure, as has been submitted, that the MOU would be implemented.  This was
                     something to which he was entitled to give weight.  As Mr&nbsp;Dunlop reminded us, questions
                     of weight are not for this Court on an appeal in cases such as this.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Turning to the position of the UNHCR, the judge did give respect to their unique position
                     and institutional expertise.  He considered their views but was not bound to follow
                     them.  The fact is that, in the context of the relatively short interim period which
                     the judge was considering, the evidence for the UNHCR did not lead to the conclusion
                     that it was likely that an individual claimant would be improperly returned to another
                     state without proper consideration of their asylum claim in Rwanda in the brief interim
                     period.  There simply would not be time for all of those steps to be taken, especially
                     in the circumstances we have already ready described above, in which the MOU and Notes
                     Verbales are in place.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In those circumstances, since the only individual claimant now before us cannot obtain
                     interim relief, it is strictly unnecessary to consider Ground&nbsp;3.  In any event, we
                     agree with the judge that applications for interim relief in this context must be
                     considered on an individual basis and not&nbsp;a&nbsp;generic basis.  Otherwise, the Respondent
                     could be prevented from implementing her policy of removal even in&nbsp;a&nbsp;case in which
                     there is no legal defect in the individual decision-making process at all.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In this context, we bear in mind that, as recent events have shown, the Secretary
                     of State continues to consider each case on its individual facts and has been prepared
                     to revoke removal directions in&nbsp;a&nbsp;number of cases while these proceedings have been
                     taking place and even over the weekend since the judgment below was given.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We return to the fundamental point in this case, which turns on how the judge dealt
                     with the balance of convenience.  In our judgment he conducted that balancing exercise
                     properly.  He did not err in principle in the approach which he took.  He weighed
                     all the relevant factors on each side of the balance.  He reached&nbsp;a&nbsp;conclusion which
                     he was reasonably entitled to reach on the material before him.  This Court cannot
                     therefore interfere with that conclusion.
