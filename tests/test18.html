            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">(1)</span></span> <span><i><u>MB (OLF and MTA – risk) Ethiopia</u></i><i> CG [2007] UKAIT 00030 still accurately reflects the situation facing members and
                     supporters of the OLF if returned to Ethiopia. However, in material respects, it is
                     appropriate to clarify the existing guidance.</i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">(2)</span></span> <span><i>OLF members and supporters and those specifically perceived by the authorities to
                     be such members or supporters will in general be at real risk if they have been previously
                     arrested or detained on suspicion of OLF involvement.</i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">(3)</span></span> <span><i>Those who have a significant history, known to the authorities, of OLF membership
                     or support, or are perceived by the authorities to have such significant history will
                     in general be at real risk of persecution by the authorities.   </i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">(4)</span></span> <span><i><span style="color:#000000">‘Significant’ should not be read as denoting a very high level of involvement or support.
                        Rather, it relates to suspicion being established that a person is perceived by the
                        authorities as possessing an anti-government agenda. This is a fact sensitive assessment.</span></i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal">(5)</span></span> <span><i>Whether persons are to be excluded from recognition as refugees or from the grant
                     of humanitarian protection by reason of armed activities may need to be addressed
                     in particular cases.</i></span></p>
            <p><span><b>1.</b></span> <span><b>General application of country guidance</b></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal">(1)</span></span> <span><i>The treatment of country guidance as a presumption of fact means that it will be for
                     the parties seeking to persuade the Tribunal to depart from it to adduce the evidence
                     justifying that departure. </i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal">(2)</span></span> <span><i>An assessment as to whether to depart from a CG decision is to be undertaken as to:
                     (i) whether material circumstances have changed; and (ii) whether such changes are
                     well established evidentially and durable.</i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal">(3)</span></span> <span><i>The law, and the principle, are not affected by the age of the CG decision. It may
                     be that as time goes on, evidence will become available that makes it more likely
                     that departure from the decision will be justified. But the process remains the same,
                     and unless in the individual case the departure is shown to be justified, the guidance
                     contained in the CG decision must, as a matter of law, be adopted.</i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal">(4)</span></span> <span><i>If the parties fail to abide by their general duty in respect of identifying extant
                     country guidance, it remains for the Tribunal to consider such guidance and to follow
                     it. </i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal">(5)</span></span> <span><i>Any failure by the Tribunal to apply a CG decision unless there is good reason, explicitly
                     stated, for not doing so might constitute an error of law in that a material consideration
                     has been ignored or legally inadequate reasons for the decision have been given.</i></span></p>
            <p><span><span style="font-style:normal">(6)</span></span> <span><i>A party that before the First-tier Tribunal has failed to address extant country guidance
                     or has failed to demonstrate proper grounds for departure from it is unlikely to have
                     a good ground of appeal against a decision founded on the guidance. </i></span></p>

                        his appeal. Reliance was primarily placed by the First-tier Tribunal upon a Danish
                        Immigration Service report, ‘<i>Ethiopia: Political situation and treatment of opposition’</i> (September 2018), which in turn relied upon interviews undertaken with sources in

                        made on an individual basis in each decision arising on the application or appeal

                        would also be a risk of inconsistent decisions, a consideration that is particularly
                        important as it follows from a decision that if one person requires protection, if

                        evidence (<u>SG (Iraq)</u> at [47]) to justify departure from the country guidance decision, the law is that

                        by law, the starting point. It will carry considerable weight even in a case where
                        departure from the guidance is justified, or where the question to be answered is
                        somewhat different from that answered by the country guidance decision: <u>SB (Sri Lanka) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department</u> [2019] EWCA Civ 160, at [70], [75].

                        to a greater or lesser extent, this task will therefore be the respondent’s. There

                        country of nationality. A general duty is therefore placed upon parties and their
                        representatives to ensure that the materials they adduce before the Tribunal include
                        relevant country guidance decisions: <u>KK (Unreported decisions - Practice Directions) Sudan</u> [2006] UKAIT 00008, at [8]. Rule 2(4)(b) of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal)

                        generally and so it will be procedurally proper for the Tribunal to ask the parties
                        at the outset of a hearing as to whether there is relevant, extant country guidance
                        and, if so, upon whom the burden of disproof falls. Such requirement is consistent

                           his accession as Prime Minister in April 2018, Prime Minister Abiy tightened his grip
                           on the party with the removal of several central committee members. The ODPO was renamed
                           the Oromo Democratic Party (ODP) in September 2018. The EPRDF coalition was subsequently
                           annulled, and its successor the pan-ethnic Prosperity Party was established on 1 December

                           Oromo singer who at the age of 17 had been imprisoned for 5 years in 2003 for participating
                           in protests. Following the release of his first album he emerged as a powerful political
                           voice and his songs were the soundtrack to the wave of anti-government protests that
                           led to the downfall of Prime Minister Hailemariam in 2018. Hachalu Hundessa was shot
                           dead on 29 June 2020 in Addis Ababa and over the following days more than 100 people

                        closure of 108 of its offices, as having depopulated the party and deprived it of

                           of clans and villages. During the last quarter of the 19th century, the Amhara-dominated
                           Ethiopian Empire expanded to the south, tripling its territory. During such time much
                           of what is now Oromia Region was conquered and forcibly incorporated into the Empire.
                           Oromo suffered exclusion, with land expropriated and institutions suppressed. There
                           were regular efforts to forcibly assimilate Oromo and the use of the indigenous language,
                           Afaan Oromoo, was banned in Ethiopia, including in political life and schools, from
                           1941 until 1991, as part of an assimilationist policy that identified the speaking
                           of Amharic as being ‘Ethiopian’. Many nationalist Oromo identify a long, difficult

                           which was exacerbated upon the TPLF supporting the creation of the OPDO. In 1991,
                           the OLF joined the TPLF-led transitional government, but its leadership became convinced
                           that it would not be allowed to compete fairly against the OPDO in the 1992 elections.

                           scene, the OLF retained its status as a symbol of Oromo nationalism. From 1992 onwards
                           it waged an armed struggle in Ethiopia, accepting military training and assistance
                           from Eritrea.</span></p>

                           2018 the OLF and the Ethiopian government signed a peace deal following talks in Asmara,
                           Eritrea. They agreed to reconciliation and to form a joint committee overseeing the
                           implementation of the agreement. In September 2018 the OLF leadership returned to
                           Addis Ababa before a crowd of several hundred thousand people and soon afterwards
                           some returnees took up positions offered by the Oromia Region government. </span>In October 2018 the OLF confirmed that it was working on disarming its soldiers, though

                           began to be tightened, with federal and regional authorities reverting to repressive
                           methods in order to maintain law and order. Both federal and regional authorities
                           regularly used significant restrictive measures to address bouts of public violence,
                           often political in nature. Such methods included significant efforts to curb political
                           opposition, with the adverse interest of the security forces directed towards the
                           OLF. During the crackdown after the assassination of Hachalu Hundessa, many members
                           and supporters of the OLF were arrested, accused of orchestrating or enacting the
                           violence and subjected to lengthy detention. The authorities replicated tactics commonly
                           used in the EPRDF era by arresting OLF leaders, members and supporters, detaining
                           many for extended periods without bringing them to court, and re-arresting others
                           who entered the criminal justice system and were released by courts </span></p>

                           of the OLF chairman, Dawud Ibsa, amounting to house arrest. The first occasion was
                           from 17 July 2020 following the murder of Hachalu Hundessa. He was released on 31
                           July 2020. On 12 October 2020, he was giving a media briefing at his home in respect
                           of the party’s proposal that a National Transitional Government of Oromia be established.
                           Security forces attended and interrupted the meeting. Journalists who attended the
                           meeting were arrested, as were several other attendees. A significant number of uniformed
                           men surrounded the residence barring entry and exit. On 2 April 2021 Dawub Ibsa was
                           placed under house arrest and the security guards previously assigned by the government
                           to protect him were removed. From 3 May 2021 he was held incommunicado when his house
                           was raided by armed security forces. His computers and telephones were confiscated.
                           On 15 June 2021 Amnesty International wrote a letter addressed to the Minister of

                           of the OLF’s central committee, was arrested on 17 January 2019. In September 2019,
                           he was charged along with seventeen others in relation to terrorism offences. Following
                           his acquittal in May 2021 heavily armed persons wearing the uniform of the federal
                           police attended Kalinto prison where the thirteen defendants were awaiting the processing
                           of their release and took them away to an unknown location. The deputy attorney general

                           commission. Colonel Gemechu Ayana had previously accused the authorities of torture

                           their release. Two OLF members were arrested in June 2020 and detained at separate
                           detention centres. They were charged with terrorism and granted bail by the Oromia
                           Supreme Court in November 2020. They were rearrested later that month when they attended
                           court. The Supreme Court dismissed the charges against the men in December 2020, but
                           the Oromia Region police did not comply with the ruling and kept the men at various
                           police stations over time. The Oromia Supreme Court ordered the commissioner of the
                           Oromia Region police to appear before it in March 2021 and explain why there had been
                           non-compliance with its order of December 2020. The commissioner failed to attend
                           the hearing and sent no representative. The Oromia Supreme Court ordered the release
                           of the men, who were re-arrested as they left the court premises and taken to a detention

                        and foremost, the party did not contest the federal and regional elections in 2021,
                        thereby denying the electorate the opportunity to cast votes for the senior Oromo
                        nationalist party. Further, the pressure contributed to the enlarging of existing
                        divisions within the party. The OLF has long been a fractured organisation, not only
                        in respect of its relations with its former armed wing, but also consequent to strong
                        disagreements within the party as to how it should move forward, coupled with significant
                        personality differences. Against the backdrop of an upsurge in arrests and detention
                        of its members, the fractured nature of the OLF’s leadership led to a significant
                        dispute arising between Dawud Ibsa and deputy chairman Ararso Biqila resulting in
                        both asserting that they run the party.

                           in the Chercher Mountains as its military wing: the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA). From
                           1992 onwards the exiled OLF waged an armed struggle in Ethiopia through the OLA by
                           means of guerrilla warfare. To many observers such military actions were largely ineffectual
                           and provided no serious military threat to the Ethiopian government. However, the
                           OLA’s military actions led to the Ethiopian authorities designating the OLF as a terrorist
                           organisation in June 2011.</span></p>

                           peace agreement and committed to laying down arms. Integration and disarmament proved
                           in many cases to be unsuccessful. The OLA remained its own security force, with its
                           own leadership and strongholds. Years of unrest weakened regional government control
                           in areas of Oromia Region such as Welega and Guji. Upon the return of the OLF and
                           OLA to Ethiopia in 2018, returnees stepped into the security vacuum in these areas,
                           sometimes working with the police to enforce order. However, there were accusations
                           that the regional government had reneged upon promises to employ OLA fighters as police
                           officers and were singling them out for arrest and beatings. In turn, the regional
                           government accused the OLA of keeping their weapons. By late 2018, members of the
                           OLA had returned to the forests and were killing officials and attacking army convoys.
                           In 2019 the federal government reported that the national air force was bombing OLA

                           despite having previously agreed to a ceasefire in 2018, the government had continued
                           to arrest its members and wage war upon it. It accused the government of failing to
                           abide by the ceasefire agreement and recommenced military activity in Oromia Region.

                           Oromia Region, including targeting and killing minorities such as Amhara, villages
                           subjected to plunder with cattle stolen accompanied by houses being set on fire, Christian
                           religious sites being attacked and looted, and the targeted murder of bus passengers.
                           The OLA denies its involvement in such attacks. The authorities also accuse the OLA
                           of engaging in assassination, with targeted killings of numerous local administrators.
                           There have also been regular reports of deaths consequent to OLA ambushes. The decision
                           to attack government officials and police officers in small towns and villages forms
                           part of a strategy to make areas of Oromia Region ungovernable for the federal and
                           regional governments. The OLA has claimed responsibility for some deaths on social
                           media, though it has also engaged in correspondence with the Addis Standard magazine
                           addressing allegations made against it and declaring that “our troops face stiff penalties
                           for killing civilians; there is no tolerance for such acts.” </span></p>

                        2020, which details that despite the encouraging signs in the early months of Abiy
                        Ahmed’s Premiership, “which, along with many others, [Amnesty International] praised
                        at the time, we are increasingly concerned at what appears to be a downward spiral
                        for human rights in the country.” The letter observes, “it is increasingly apparent
                        that the security apparatus has used the rise of a relatively small OLA as a pretext
                        for a widespread crackdown on supporters and perceived supporters of Oromo nationalism
                        in general and the OLF in particular, who are viewed as a threat to the territorial
                        integrity of the state and an obstacle to the current government and its agenda.”
                        Regional and federal security forces are identified to have overseen a campaign of
                        mass arbitrary arrests and detentions; the routine use of torture and other serious
                        ill-treatment; and the use of extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances

                              as a terrorist group in 2018, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in Addis Ababa
                              to welcome back its leaders, although sources noted subsequent arrests. In April 2019
                              the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) split from the OLF political party and in May the
                              OLF stated it would merge with the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC). In November 2019,
                              the OLF registered with the election board (NEBE) as a political organisation, agreeing
                              to work with other political parties in Oromia state. In January 2020, the OLF signed
                              an agreement with the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) and Oromo Nationalist Party
                              (ONP) to form a coalition in the forthcoming elections (at the time of writing postponed
                              indefinitely). However, some sources indicate that the OLF (and the OLA) may not be
                              a single entity, but has fractured into a number of sub-groups and in some areas is
                              not controlled by a single person or entity. OLF sources told the Home Office in September
                              2019 that they operated in Addis Ababa and the surrounding area and had opened 40
                              offices in 2019 across the country, although 30 subsequently closed.’

                              that designation as a terrorist organisation has been removed by the state, its leaders

                              able to operate and work with other political parties. OLF supporters and members
                              do continue to face harassment and arrest from the state however, the available evidence

                              in the hundreds of thousands to millions – throughout Ethiopia are at risk of treatment
                              amounting to persecution by its nature and/or repetition. The assessment of risk for
                              a person will vary between different areas of Ethiopia and within Oromia itself. OLF
                              members or supporters in Oromia, particularly in areas where armed conflict between
                              the OLA and the armed forces continues, face a higher risk of treatment that amounts
                              to persecution than those in Addis Ababa.

                                 across Oromia State between 2014 and 2018, DFAT assesses this was not ethnically motivated,
                                 but reflected the then-federal government’s sensitivity to political opposition. The
                                 situation for government critics, including ethnic Oromos, has improved significantly
                                 since April 2018. DFAT assesses that individuals who are part of, or have links to,
                                 armed OLF factions engaged in criminal activities and clashes with government forces
                                 are likely to be of interest to the authorities, and face a moderate risk of arrest

                                 that, excluding in Addis Ababa, Oromos face a moderate risk of violence in areas or
                                 states where they constitute a minority.’ [Emphasis added]</span></p>

                           while the evidence upon which COI reports rely is filtered, it is – importantly -
                           sourced. Consequently, these reports are to be treated in the same way as any other

                        of the OLF, Dawud Ibsa, had been subjected to house arrest; several leading members
                        of the party had been arrested, detained and in some cases held for several months
                        without charge; and several thousand people had been arrested in June and July 2020
                        following violent disturbances in Oromia Region and Addis Ababa, many of whom were
                        - or were suspected to be - members and supporters of the OLF. Many thousands were
                        to remain in detention for long periods of time in poor detention conditions or were
                        subjected to cyclical arrest, release and re-arrest. Re-education was conducted upon
                        detainees held in military camps. Further, the OLF was subject to significant obstruction
                        in respect of opening and running party offices, including the occupation of its office
                        in Addis Ababa by police officers on 1 August 2020 and the resulting bar upon party
                        officials and members from entering the premises. Such circumstances are either given

                        in the obstruction of the OLF’s on-the-ground activities. Such regression has become

                        the position of the optimists who consider the progression of the political reforms
                        initiated by Prime Minister Abiy in 2018 to be on-going and succeeding. The respondent
                        had successfully persuaded that Tribunal to reject the more pessimistic view that
                        the Ethiopian government has reverted to its authoritarian and repressive past. However,
                        save for the optimistic conclusions reached in the <i>DFAT Report</i>, the expert and objective evidence points to there being significant regression in

                        continues to enjoy lawful status, its ability to operate is being significantly impeded

                           for the OLF can be traced to the 2005 decision in </span><u>HA (OLF Members and sympathisers – risk) Ethiopia</u> where it appears, for the first time, in the penultimate paragraph. No elaboration
                        is given as to the meaning of ‘significant history’, but we note that the Tribunal
                        accepted the evidence set out in a Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU) report
                        of April 2004 as to the arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of ‘thousands of OLF
                        members and sympathisers’. In 2007, the evidential finding<span style="color:#FF0000"> </span>in <u>HA</u> was converted into formal guidance by the Tribunal in <u>MB (OLF and MTA – risk)</u>. Again, the term is not defined. In that case the Tribunal accepted, without qualification,
                        the evidence of country expert Dr Roy Love. It was his evidence that the <i>modus operandi</i> of the Ethiopian security forces was to arrest large numbers of civilians, accusing
                        them of OLF involvement, only to release, then re-arrest in a cycle of harassment
                        and ill-treatment. Others were kept in arbitrary detention for prolonged periods,
                        often without hearing or cause shown, sometimes incommunicado. The Tribunal also considered
                        a range of evidence identifying the use of torture by the authorities. We note that
                        this accords with Prime Minister Abiy’s subsequent admission to Parliament that the
                        EPRDF engaged, for many years, in the systemic use of torture against perceived opponents.
                        This was the context in which the previous Tribunal, whose guidance we are invited
                        to uphold, employed the term.

                        outlined in the CPINs illustrate, many thousands continue to be arrested in sweeps,
                        such as that which occurred in the aftermath of the murder of <span style="color:#000000">Hachalu Hundessa. These civilians are then subject to the same cycle of arrest/release/re-arrest
                           as that identified by Dr Love over 15 years ago. Whilst it cannot be said that </span><i><span style="color:#000000">any</span></i><span style="color:#000000"> level of support for the OLF will give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution,
                           it cannot be said that ‘significant’ must denote a high-level or prominent connection
                           to the party. We note Mr. Southerden’s evidence on behalf of Amnesty International,
                           consistent with other evidence placed before us, that “both formal arrest warrants
                           and institutional as well as personal memory of individual officers plays a major
                           role in determining who is perceived as possessing an anti-government agenda and therefore
                           subject to suspicion.” This local, and informal, approach is the context in which
                           we must place the numbers of those arrested. We therefore conclude that ‘significant’
                           should not be read as necessarily denoting a very high level of involvement or support.
                           Rather, it relates to suspicion being established that a person is perceived by the
                           authorities as possessing an anti-government agenda. This is a fact sensitive assessment.

                        of the OLF. The Ethiopian authorities attended the family home twice in 2013 looking
                        for the appellant’s father but he was not at home on either occasion. His absence
                        led to the property being ransacked. Eventually the appellant’s father was arrested

                        before being transferred to hospital in 2016, consequent to injuries suffered through

                        the appellant sustained an injury to his right eye which led to impaired vision. He
                        was subsequently arrested after his beating and detained in prison for 10 days. To
                        secure his release he was required to sign a declaration that he would not in future

                        seeking greater rights for the Oromo people. He was again arrested and detained for
                        28 days. Whilst in detention he was beaten on four separation occasions leaving him
                        with scarring. He was released following the payment of a bribe by his uncle on the
                        understanding that he was to be listed as an escapee. He subsequently left Ethiopia.

               for use as a vehicle for a new country guidance case on the issues last determined
               in the case of MB (OLF and MTA – risk) Ethiopia CG [2007] UKAIT 00030 (hereafter referred
               to as MB). We understand that it is the Secretary of State’s position, accepted by
               the First Tier Tribunal Judge, that there has been [sic] there are very strong grounds,
               supported by cogent evidence of a change in circumstances in Ethiopia, to justify
               a departure from the findings in MB. A panel of the UT will be considering whether
               the current country guidance in MB should continue to apply.</span></p>

               questions regarding your client’s case, in light of our organisation’s ongoing research
               and experience of human rights conditions in Ethiopia:</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 1: Do Oromo Liberation Front members and sympathisers (whether perceived
                  or otherwise) continue to be at real risk of persecution in Ethiopia?</span></b></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 2: To what extent does the above depend on profile; (with reference to the
                  appellant’s case for instance)?</span></b></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 3: Are you able to comment on the assertion by the Home Office at 2.4.26
                  of their July CPIN on Ethiopia that there are very strong grounds supported by cogent
                  evidence to depart from the Upper Tribunal findings in the current country guidance
                  case of MB (OLF and MTA – risk) Ethiopia CG [2007] UKAIT 00030 (29 March 2007) set

                  security forces?</span></b></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 5: Is there today likely to be a presumption by the state that an Oromo person

         <p><span style="color:#000000">Having read these documents and emails to us, we understand that [the appellant] is
               a young man and an Ethiopian national of Oromo ethnicity. He states that he is the
               son of a farmer and OLF supporter. He states that in 2013 (when [the appellant] would
               have been aged around 13) police raided his family home on several occasions looking
               for his father, and that his father was eventually arrested in February 2014 due to
               his involvement with the OLF. He states that his father was held in Dallomana prison
               until Jan 2016 when he was taken to hospital, weak from beatings and torture. [The
               appellant] states that in 2015 a fellow pupil brought an OLF flag to his school and
               distributed it and displayed it amongst the pupils. The police arrived, rounded the
               students up and questioned them. [The appellant] states he was beaten and arrested
               and then held in Dallomana prison for 10 days before being made to sign a promise
               not to be involved with the OLF again and threatened he would be killed if he did
               so. He states that despite this he began secretly attending OLF meetings, distributing
               leaflets and in February 2016 took part in an OLF demonstration against police misconduct
               in the region. He states that he was arrested again and detained, this time for 28
               days during which time he states he was beaten and questioned about his activities.
               He states he was released after payment of a bribe, by his uncle, and that it was
               then arranged for him to travel on the overland route out of the country.</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000"><u>Background – Human Rights in Ethiopia</u></span></b></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">This section refers to information published in our recent public report, ‘Beyond
               Law Enforcement: Human Rights Violations By Ethiopian Security Forces In Amhara and
               Oromia’, and should be read alongside that report.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Ethiopia has been ruled since 1991 by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic
               Front (EPRDF); a coalition of ethnically-based parties representative of the main
               regions in Ethiopia’s ethnic-federal constitutional system, dominated by the Tigray
               People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The EPRDF pursued a highly autocratic and repressive
               governing strategy, criminalising and in other ways targeting political opponents,
               real and perceived, and imposing strong controls on freedoms of expression, assembly
               and association. Arbitrary detention, unfair trials and trumped up charges were commonly
               used, and abuses in custody up to and including torture and extrajudicial executions
               were widespread. </span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">The EPRDF also fought a prolonged war against the Oromo Liberation Front (and its
               armed wing the Oromo Liberation Army, OLA), an Oromo nationalist group that had fought
               against the previous government of Mengistu Hailemariam and which in 1991 was briefly
               part of a transitional government led by the EPRDF coalition. The OLF always had an
               uneasy relationship with the TPLF, and these tensions led to the OLF leaving the transitional
               government in 1992 to take up a low-level armed struggle against the government. 
               The OLF stated that its fundamental objective was to exercise the Oromo peoples’ right
               to self-determination. The EPRDF viewed them as violent separatists threatening the
               integrity of the nation.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Moving to the years 2014 and 2015, spurred by the government’s systemic human rights
               repression, as well as economic and political marginalisation, youth in the Oromia
               and Amhara regions launched a wave of what would become large scale and sustained
               street demonstrations, of a kind that had not previously been seen in the country
               under the EPRDF. The government used excessive, and often lethal, force to quell the
               protests, killing, beating and arresting protesters. The protests continued until
               February 2018, when the then Prime Minister Hailemariam Dessalegn was forced to resign.
               He was replaced by a new Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, the first Oromo to hold the post.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">In an attempt to appease the public protest, Prime Minister Abiy, announced reforms
               to address economic issues as well as structural and systematic human rights issues.
               Thousands of prisoners who were serving sentences on politically motivated charges
               were released. The state of war with neighbouring Eritrea was ended and relations
               were normalised. Bans on many websites and independent news outlets were lifted; and
               a number of opposition groups were removed from the official government terrorist
               list. This latter move included the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), whose leaders were
               told it was safe to return to the country from their prolonged exile abroad.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">In response, many senior political opponents in the Ethiopian diaspora, including
               a number of OLF figures, return to the country after agreeing to pursue peaceful means
               to achieve their political goals. National parliamentary elections were scheduled
               for 2020 and in November 2019 Prime Minister Abiy, as chairman of the EPRDF, dissolved
               the coalition and merged most of its constituent parties into a new coalition party
               to contest the elections, named the Prosperity Party. The TPLF did not become part
               of this new coalition party.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">However, despite the ambitious reform agenda pursued by Prime Minister Abiy, there
               were a number of key areas that remained untouched. In particular, the state security
               apparatus, including the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF), the regional police
               forces and government-controlled local militias, remained largely unreformed. While
               the government took some steps to ensure accountability for past human rights violations
               (principally the prosecution of some federal security officers accused of torture
               and ill-treatment of detainees) little was done to address the abusive practices of
               security forces and the leadership, institutional culture and legal framework that
               enabled them. The truth about the depth of past human rights violations committed
               since 1991 is yet to come out and reparations for victims remained elusive. The bulk
               of past atrocities in Ethiopia – including widespread acts of killing, torture and
               other ill-treatment, and excessive use of force against protesters – remained unaccounted
               for.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">At the same time, the period during which Prime Minister Abiy’s government was instituting
               its human rights reforms was interspersed with political and ethnic tensions that
               prompted military insurgencies and inter-communal violence in Amhara, Oromia, Harar,
               Dire Dawa, Benishangul and the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP) regions.
               In particular, a splinter wing broke away from the Oromo Liberation Army, the military
               wing of the OLF, after rejecting the OLF’s adoption of exclusively peaceful means.
               The OLA splinter group staged armed attacks in Western and Southern parts of Oromia.
               In response to the armed violence in January 2019 the government launched a law-enforcement
               offensive, ostensibly against the OLA, arguing that violent ethnic separatists posed
               a fundamental threat to the liberalising reform programme that Prime Minister Abiy
               was trying to institute.</span><sup>2</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Over the next year, regional and federal security forces oversaw a campaign of mass
               arbitrary arrests and detentions; the routine use of torture and other serious ill-treatment;
               and the use of extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances in the Oromia
               region and elsewhere. In addition, security forces have arbitrarily banned certain
               flags and expressions and/or the use of mobile phones; imposed internet blackouts
               and physical curfews, movement restrictions and checkpoints; and in some cases have
               been implicated in forced evictions. The OLA were not, however, the main target for
               these tactics. Oromo civilians resident in areas of suspected OLA activity were arbitrarily
               targeted and accused of providing practical and moral support to the OLA. Individuals
               perceived as being associated with the OLF, (whether through membership, support,
               historic association through security agency records, or family ties) were particularly
               targeted, on the pretext of support for the OLA and terrorist violence, but a far
               wider group of people, either associated with other Oromo nationalist groups, such
               as the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), or in some cases having no association beyond
               being Oromo and living in a certain area, were also caught up in these arrests.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Moving into 2020, the year was designated as a national election year, with parliamentary
               elections due to be held in August. However, following the start of the global coronavirus
               pandemic the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) postponed the elections indefinitely,
               on the grounds that it was not safe to conduct ordinary campaigning and polling practices.
               This was inevitably a highly contentious decision and how the country will move forward
               from this point is still being heatedly debated. Our current understanding of the
               official position is that the elections will now be held in May or June 2021.</span><sup>3</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">In the meantime, in a move that escalated the tension between the Federal government
               and the Regional government in Tigray, the TPLF - a party which controls all the seats
               in the Tigray Regional State Parliament – held a regional election in September 2020.
               This move was deemed unconstitutional by the NEBE and the results were not recognised
               by the national government. In response the government withheld the national budget
               allocation for the region, which has been met with a vociferous response from the
               TPLF leadership and heightened tensions.</span><sup>4</sup><span style="color:#000000"> During the period when this letter was being prepared, the Ethiopian government announced
               that military action would be taken against the TPLF in Tigray. The government blamed
               the TPLF for attacking the Ethiopian National Defence Force’s Northern Command based
               in the regional capital Mekelle, after “months of continued provocations and incitement
               for violence by the TPLF”.</span><sup>5</sup><span style="color:#000000"> While not directly relevant to this case, this is an important and concerning development
               both in its own terms and in demonstrating the strength of the Ethiopian federal government’s
               response to the rival ethnically-based regional political groupings it faces.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">In Oromia, prior to the general election’s suspension the OLF held a commanding lead
               in the polls and were widely predicted to win political control of the region away
               from the Oromo Democratic Party (formerly known as the Oromo Peoples’ Democratic Organisation
               (OPDO)), which has governed the region as part of the EPRDF coalition since 1991.
               However, the postponement of the elections was combined with both targeted arrests
               and killings of leading OLF figures and the ongoing use of mass-scale arbitrary arrests
               and other repressive tactics targeted at OLF activists and supporters in the region.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">In the early hours of 29 February 2020, security officers stormed a guest house in
               the southern part of Addis Ababa where five senior members of the OLF and four supporters
               were staying. All nine were arrested. While eight were subsequently released, Abdi
               Regassa, a member of the OLF’s Executive Committee who had previously returned to
               the country from exile following the 2018 reforms, was held in incommunicado detention.</span><sup>6</sup><span style="color:#000000"> On 7th March, three OLF members, including a member of the Central Committee and
               a political officer, were arrested by police immediately after visiting Abdi Regassa.
               Despite having charges against them dropped and their release ordered by a court at
               the end of March, police continue to hold them in detention.</span><sup>7</sup><span style="color:#000000"> On 3 June 2020 Bekele Bidra, the head of the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) office
               in Bole Sub-City of Addis Ababa was killed in his car.</span><sup>8</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Perhaps most significantly, given the consequences, on 29th June, Hachalu Hundessa
               a very popular Oromo singer, was shot and killed in the street in Addis Ababa.</span><sup>9</sup><span style="color:#000000"> A week earlier he had given a controversial interview to the Oromo Media Network
               (OMN), a youth-orientated Oromo nationalist television network. In the aftermath of
               his killing, protests sprang up in Addis Ababa and the Oromia region, some of which
               degenerated into intercommunal violence, which together with a violent police response
               left at least 177 dead and hundreds wounded.</span><sup>10</sup><span style="color:#000000"> The Ethiopian government has sought to place the blame for the killing on the ’OLF-Shene’,
               Shene being a term for the armed factions of the OLA, and suspects have been charged.
               They deny the charges, as does the OLF-Shene. The suggestion is widely disbelieved
               in Oromia, but we are yet to see the strength of the evidence in the case.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Following these protests the police arrested thousands of people, many of whom remain
               in incommunicado detention with their whereabouts unknown. The arrests continued for
               weeks and reached over 10,000 people at their height.</span><sup>11</sup><span style="color:#000000"> Many of those arrested were OLF and Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) members and supporters,
               while others were accused of being so. On 30th June, Jawar Mohamed, a leading figure
               at the Oromo Media Network and for the OFC, was arrested on charges relating to the
               killing of a policeman during the protests. He and 22 others connected to the OMN
               have since been charged with terrorism offences.</span><sup>12</sup><span style="color:#000000">  On 26th July reports emerged that Daud Ibssa, the Chairman of the OLF, who had returned
               to the country from exile in 2018, had been placed under house arrest.</span><sup>13</sup><span style="color:#000000"> He was subsequently freed, but was again placed under house arrest in October, when
               a press conference he was holding from his home was raided by the authorities. Journalists
               for Oromo nationalist outlets and others attending the press conference were arrested
               and taken away when they tried to leave.</span><sup>14</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">In August, widespread reports emerged of further killings of protesters and perceived
               supporters of the OLF by security forces in Addis Ababa and various towns around Oromia.
               While we have not been able to verify the exact number of dead, we have confirmed
               that at least 20 protesters were killed and believe that the real figure is likely
               to be higher than that; there are reports of dozens more being killed.</span><sup>15</sup><span style="color:#000000"> The killings were part of a disproportionate use of force against demonstrators protesting
               about the arrest of Jawar Mohamed and about the mass arrests following the killing
               of Hachalu Hundessa.</span><sup>16</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Targeted killings of individuals by security officers have also continued, either
               following accusations of involvement with the OLF-Shene, or in some instances with
               no explanation at all. Recent, non-exhaustive, examples include the October 23rd killing
               of five young men in the town of Nekemte in the East Wollega zone of western Oromia
               by the Oromia Special Police. Police stated that the men had been involved in the
               killing of a policeman the week before and had fired on officers when the house they
               were in was raided. Other witnesses reported that the men were unarmed, uninvolved
               with the armed movement and were extrajudicially executed in their homes after an
               anonymous denouncement.</span><sup>17</sup><span style="color:#000000"> Two days later, on 25</span><sup><span style="color:#000000">th</span></sup><span style="color:#000000"> October, university lecturer Fecadu Tolera was reportedly shot dead, again by Oromia
               Special Police officers outside his house. No official explanation has been given
               for his killing. Oromo nationalist supporters believe it was connected to his academic
               publications discussing the history of the foundation of Ethiopia and Oromia’s place
               within it.</span><sup>18</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">On 1st November, at least 54 people from the Amhara ethnic group were killed in an
               attack on Gawa Qanqa village in Guliso District of West Wellega Zone. The attack appears
               to have been carried out by members of the OLA. The attack took place just a day after
               Ethiopian National Defence Force troops withdrew from the area unexpectedly and without
               explanation. Witnesses said dozens of men, women and children were killed, property
               looted and what the militants could not carry away, they set on fire.</span><sup>19</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">On Sunday 8</span><sup><span style="color:#000000">th</span></sup><span style="color:#000000"> November 2020, Prime Minister Abiy announced a slate of changes at the top level
               of the security apparatus, replacing the heads of the ENDF, the National Intelligence
               and Security Service, the Federal Police and also Ethiopia’s Foreign Minister.</span><sup>20</sup><span style="color:#000000"> These appointments appear to be more a reshuffling than a serious sign of reform
               from a human rights perspective. None of the new appointees are new faces to the security
               sector; all have been part of the system for a very long time holding other senior
               posts. The reason for the reshuffle appears to be more to do with loyalty to Prime
               Minister Abiy and commitment to the current military operations against the TPLF,
               mentioned above, done with any reform agenda.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">With this background in mind, we will now address each of your questions in turn.</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 1: Do Oromo Liberation Front members and sympathisers (whether perceived
                  or otherwise) continue to be at real risk of persecution in Ethiopia?</span></b></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">As is set out in our summary of the background above, Ethiopia has undergone, and
               is continuing to undergo, significant political developments in the last few years.
               The change of Prime Minister has brought both a new agenda for government and some
               important symbolic developments in a country that continues to suffer from ethnic
               division and factionalism; in particular the coming to power of the first Oromo prime
               minister. However, there is an inherent tension in a liberalising reform agenda being
               pursued by a new Prime Minister at the head of a governing coalition that is very
               similar to the previous one, and without fundamental reform to the security services.
               This is particularly the case in the context of the ongoing popularity of influential
               regional/ethnic separatist movements such as the OLF, tensions between the federal
               government and the Tigray regional government of the TPLF, and increasing incidents
               of inter-ethnic violence across the country, particularly targeting minorities.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Despite the encouraging signs of the first months of Prime Minister Abiy’s rule, which,
               along with many others, our organisation praised at the time, we are increasingly
               concerned at what appears to be a downward spiral for human rights in the country.
               As was noted above, most recently this has been indicated by the announcement of a
               military operation against the TPLF, but has now long been the case in the Oromia,
               and also the Amhara, regions. What may have begun as a police action to deal with
               a relatively small armed splinter group, the OLA, and violent attacks on ethnic minorities
               in the region, particularly Amharas, has now in our assessment gone well beyond law
               enforcement.</span><sup>21</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">It is increasingly apparent that the security apparatus has used the rise of a relatively
               small OLA as a pretext for a widespread crackdown on supporters and perceived supporters
               of Oromo nationalism in general and the OLF in particular, who are viewed as a threat
               to the territorial integrity of the state and an obstacle to the current government
               and its agenda. This crackdown has come in the context of Federal and Regional elections
               that, prior to their suspension due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the OLF and other
               nationalist parties were expected to do very well in; potentially displacing the political
               leadership the security services had been loyal to since the early 1990s. As discussed
               above, those with OLF backgrounds have been targeted in the crackdown, but so have
               others unconnected to the OLF but affiliated with other Oromo nationalist organisations,
               including journalists and others working for nationalist-sympathising media outlets,
               such as the Oromo Media Network (OMN) and members of other nationalist groups such
               as the OFC. Others still have also been caught up through participation in protests
               or mere residence in areas targeted by the security services. Those arrested are increasingly
               and routinely labelled as ‘OLF-Shene’; Shene being a term for the armed factions of
               the OLA. It is therefore more instructive, in our view, to focus on the question of
               Oromo people perceived as opponents of the new government, who are then as a result
               either perceived or labelled as OLF activists, than solely on those people with documented
               histories of OLF involvement specifically.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">As part of this, we would emphasise the extreme arbitrariness of the Ethiopian security
               services’ conduct in Oromia and in its dealings with Oromo people perceived as political
               opponents of the government. While this is a longstanding issue, it is particularly
               pronounced at the present time, where mass-roundups, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial
               executions are regular occurrences, alongside indiscriminate violence in response
               to public demonstration and perceived dissent. In Oromia, the grounds on which a person
               can be accused or perceived of being a supporter of the OLF, and therefore a potential
               supporter of the OLA and a threat to the government, are broad, dependent on the whims
               of the officers involved and to an extent unpredictable. As discussed in our ‘Beyond
               Law Enforcement’ report, in recent months the reasons have included simply being Oromo
               and living in a certain location, or because a person’s mobile phone rang and interrupted
               a public meeting.</span><sup>22</sup><span style="color:#000000"> While specific individuals are certainly targeted, based on suspicion of OLF involvement,
               the arbitrariness of the security services’ conduct has meant that in multiple instances,
               where security officials were not able to find the suspects they were looking for,
               they arrested or abducted family members including children. In one instance, the
               police physically assaulted an 8-year-old girl, because they couldn’t find her mother
               at home when they came to arrest her.</span><sup>23</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">As a general statement, our organisation’s assessment is that Oromo Liberation Front
               members and sympathisers (whether perceived or otherwise) do continue to be at risk
               in Ethiopia. Further details about the nature and extent of that risk will be discussed
               in our response to the questions below.</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 2: To what extent does the above depend on profile; (with reference to the
                  appellant’s case for instance)?</span></b></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">There are a number of ways in which a person’s profile is relevant to the level of
               risk they face.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Firstly, much of the targeting of individuals perceived as members or supporters of
               the OLF is conducted by local militia and police forces, informing and working alongside
               federal forces operating in the region. These local militia and police officers are
               stationed in local communities, ostensibly providing protection and security services
               to the community, but also providing intelligence gathering on perceived anti-government
               activists and their supporters for the authorities. As has been, and will be, highlighted
               throughout this letter, security force operatives conduct themselves with high levels
               of arbitrariness and benefit from a high degree of impunity from accountability, even
               following the Prime Minister’s reforms. In this context, both formal arrest records
               and institutional as well as personal memory of individual officers play a major role
               in determining who is perceived as possessing an anti-government agenda and therefore
               subject to suspicion.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">This makes a history of arrest for OLF or other Oromo nationalist activity an important
               risk factor in the current context. It also makes a family history of OLF or other
               Oromo nationalist activity a significant risk factor. This institutional and personal
               memory at the local level routinely extends to identifying whole families as supporters
               of the OLF, based on the political activities of one or two members, or holding the
               whole family responsible for the activities of one or two members.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">While men, and young men in particular, make up the majority of those targeted by
               the authorities or caught up in mass arrests, gender and age do not appear to offer
               any significant level of protection against suspicion and targeting by the authorities.
               Our researchers found that women are routinely targeted for arrest, often on accusations
               of providing support for the ‘OLF-Shene’. Likewise, older people and children have
               also been targeted, particularly those who have family connections to ‘OLF-Shene’
               suspects.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Another factor relates to the person’s stature within the organisation, or the extent
               of their public profile. While this is hard to precisely delineate, given the arbitrary
               nature of the security forces’ conduct and the ever-changing circumstances in the
               country, there does appear to be some limited protection from arrest afforded to very
               senior and prominent members of the OLF, whose arrest would risk causing disproportionate
               adverse consequences for the government. For example, as discussed above the chairman
               of the OLF, Daud Ibssa, has not been imprisoned. However, it appears that in these
               circumstances alternative methods are used to inhibit their capacity to operate effectively,
               including house arrest, communication shutdowns and the arrest of middle-ranking individuals
               working under and alongside them, thus leaving them isolated. At the same time, rank
               and file members and supporters benefit from no such protection.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Beyond personal profile elements, there are two points regarding geography that we
               also consider to be relevant profile factors in the question of risk.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Firstly, we have noted the statement in the Home Office’s Country Policy and Information
               Note that,</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">‘the available evidence does not indicate that all OLF activists, members or supporters
               … </span><b><span style="color:#000000"><u>throughout Ethiopia</u></span></b><span style="color:#000000"> are at risk of treatment amounting to persecution by its nature and/or repetition.
               The assessment of risk for a person </span><b><span style="color:#000000"><u>will vary between different areas of Ethiopia</u></span></b><span style="color:#000000"> and within Oromia itself’ (emphasis added)</span><sup>24</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">We are concerned that this is potentially misleading, insofar as it implies that the
               entirety of the country of Ethiopia is a relevant consideration in this case. The
               OLF, and those perceived as supporting it, are present essentially exclusively in
               Oromia and the capital Addis Ababa (which is in any case geographically encircled
               by Oromia). The realistic question, therefore, is whether there are areas of Oromia
               or Addis Ababa where the risks identified in MB no longer apply.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">On this second point, we note that the CPIN states that,</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">‘Areas such as West Wollega and Guji, in western and southern Oromia respectively,
               have been subject to government and OLA (sometimes also referred to as ‘shene’, a
               faction of the OLA), clashes, violence and killings including of civilians, attributed
               to both sides. The federal government has established military ‘command posts’ in
               these areas in an attempt to counter the OLA threat. … There have been reports of
               OLA, ‘shene’ and OLF members and sympathisers being arrested and detained, as well
               as some being extra-judicially killed, in the areas around ‘command posts’ where there
               have been notably high levels of violence and fighting, particularly in western and
               southern Oromia.’</span><sup>25</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">And goes on to argue that,</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">‘OLF members or supporters in Oromia, particularly in areas where armed conflict between
               the OLA and the armed forces continues, face a higher risk of treatment that amounts
               to persecution than those in Addis Ababa.’</span><sup>26</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">This section of the CPIN concludes by asserting that a person who is a member or supporter
               of the OLF is not at risk of persecution for that reason alone, and that each case
               must be considered on its facts, including the ‘proposed place of return’ the person
               would be being sent to.</span><sup>27</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">While we broadly agree with the thrust of the Home Office’s description of both sides’
               actions in areas such as West Wollega and Guji, and events following the introduction
               of ‘command posts’ in those regions, we are respectfully concerned that abusive conduct
               by the security forces in the rest of Oromia has not been given sufficient prominence.
               In the last year, our organisation has documented hundreds of arrests of OLF members
               and perceived supporters in East and West Hararghe (eastern zones of Oromia), North,
               west and east Shewa (northern zones of Oromia, around Addis Ababa), and East and West
               Arsi (central zones of Oromia).</span><sup>28</sup><span style="color:#000000"> Incidents like these are illustrative of the widespread nature of the crackdown on
               those perceived as OLF supporters throughout the Oromia region.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">With regards to Addis Ababa itself, our organisation has recorded instances of individuals
               associated with the OLF or OLF-supporting media networks being arrested, detained
               or attacked in Addis Ababa, in some cases repeatedly. In addition to the incidents
               discussed in the above ‘background’ section of this letter, these include the July
               arrests of OLF political officers Chaltu Takkele and Gemmechu Ayana, and Kennesa Ayana,
               a member of the OLF’s central committee.</span><sup>29</sup><span style="color:#000000"> There are also reports from the OLF, that we are yet to fully confirm, of wider scale
               arrests of OLF supporters in the city over the summer.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">The final points we would make regarding the extent to which a person perceived as
               an OLF supporter’s profile would affect the level of risk they face relates to their
               recent and ongoing participation in activism for the Oromo nationalist cause.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">While, in our view, individuals being returned to Ethiopia from the UK with a known
               history of OLF support, whether that be an arrest history or otherwise, face a significant
               risk for that reason alone, individuals who go on to continue their activism with
               the OLF on return will inevitably face an even greater risk. Likewise, individuals
               who have engaged in significant recent activism on behalf of the OLF, or other Oromo
               nationalist groups, while in the UK may also face a greater risk. This would include
               participation at the large-scale, and at times disorderly, demonstrations that have
               taken place outside the Ethiopian embassy in London over the summer of 2020.</span><sup>30</sup><span style="color:#000000"> These demonstrations were closely monitored by the Ethiopian authorities, who reportedly
               raised diplomatic complaints with the British government over what they perceived
               to be the British police’s failure to appropriately protect the Embassy and its staff.</span><sup>31</sup><span style="color:#000000"> The events have also been widely reported in Ethiopian media and videos have been
               circulated online amongst both supporters and opponents of the OLF’s cause.</span><sup>32</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">With reference to [the appellant], the appellant in this case, our organisation has
               not previously documented his case and we are therefore not able to comment on his
               background directly. We would note, however, that his claimed background, as summarised
               above, is in our experience very common amongst young supporters and activists for
               the OLF or the wider Oromo nationalist movement, including a family history of involvement,
               youth engagement and serious adverse experience with the Ethiopian security forces.
               If his background is accepted by the Tribunal, in our organisation’s view it contains
               a number of elements that in combination would indicate a significant risk of being
               perceived as a supporter of the OLF, including his age and gender, his family history
               of involvement with the OLF and his arrest history.</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 3: Are you able to comment on the assertion by the Home Office at 2.4.26
                  of their July CPIN on Ethiopia that there are very strong grounds supported by cogent
                  evidence to depart from the Upper Tribunal findings in the current country guidance

               sympathisers and those specifically perceived by the authorities to be such members
               or sympathisers will in general be at real risk if they have been previously arrested
               or detained on suspicion of OLF involvement. So too will those who have a significant
               history, known to the authorities, of OLF membership or sympathy.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Based on our ongoing research into the recent events of 2019 and 2020 documented in
               our published reports, it is our organisation’s assessment that while much has changed
               in Ethiopia since MB was promulgated in 2007, the situation has not improved sufficiently
               to justify an assertion that the risk assessment made in MB is no longer valid. Indeed,
               in our assessment, the nature and the extent of the current risks may be broader than
               the above summary position given in MB would seem to imply, insofar as the need for
               a ‘significant’ history of membership or sympathy for the OLF does not reflect the
               extent of the mass and arbitrary arrests of Oromo people, including those with little
               realistic connection to the OLF and the increasing targeting of other non-OLF Oromo
               nationalist groups, and other abuses that are being perpetrated in the Oromia region.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">One caveat we would make to this assessment is that some former OLF and other exiled
               opposition group members are now active supporters of the new government such as by
               taking up government posts or through supporting the party in public electoral activities.</span><sup>33</sup><span style="color:#000000"> We do not consider such people to be at significant risk, absent other factors, as
               the underlying basis of the risk is to Oromo people perceived by the authorities to
               be opponents of the new government, in the context of arbitrary decision making over
               suspicion or ’innocence’ conducted by local militia and police officers acting with
               impunity and with political and institutional loyalty to the new government. A former
               OLF member or supporter who went out of their way to demonstrate that they had withdrawn
               themselves entirely from politics might also be able to benefit from some level of
               protection, but this would be less reliable and in the arbitrary context described
               above, would be very difficult to precisely define.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">For these reasons, and those given in our answers to questions 1,2 and 4, while we
               agree with the Home Office’s assessment that since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came
               to power in April 2018 there has been an important change in the political landscape,
               we are respectfully of the view that the Country Policy and Information Note overstates
               the case by arguing that these constitute sufficient grounds for departing from the
               risk criteria identified in MB.</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 4: The present position of members and supporters of the OLF vis-a-vis government
                  security forces?</span></b></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, as we have noted above, despite Prime Minister
               Abiy’s reform programme the security forces remain largely unreformed across any of
               the relevant metrics, including personnel, leadership, institutional culture, political
               independence and accountability. This has been amply demonstrated by their activities
               in Oromia and elsewhere over 2019 and now into 2020. Moreover, their actions, which
               include engaging in mass arbitrary arrests and the use of extreme violence up to and
               including extrajudicial executions and torture, have been given political cover and
               downplayed by Prime Minister Abiy and his leadership group as merely ‘robust measures’.</span><sup>34</sup><span style="color:#000000"> Indeed, the reform programme has itself been invoked as justification for these actions,
               with the argument that a strong response is necessary to deal with those that the
               government views as opponents or obstacles to its agenda.</span><sup>35</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Secondly the reliance placed on the fact that a number of key OLF figures returned
               to Ethiopia in 2018 for evidence that it is now safe for OLF supporters to return
               is, in our view, undermined by many of those leaders’ subsequent arrest and detention.
               As we noted above, both Abdi Regassa and Daud Ibssa have been arrested and detained
               since returning. Other senior OLF figures detained since return include Michael Boran,
               Shigut Geleta, Lemi Benya, Kenessa Ayana and Colonel Gemechu Ayana.</span><sup>36</sup></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">The ongoing use of sweeping powers of detention against thousands of perceived OLF/OLA
               supporters may differ from previous periods of OLF suppression in terms of political
               context and external justification, but this does not change the reality of ongoing
               suppression of the Oromo nationalist movement and those Oromos perceived as engaging
               in dissent by security services loyal to the current government and acting with near
               total impunity.</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000">Question 5: Is there today likely to be a presumption by the state that an Oromo person
                  on return to Ethiopia is a member of, affiliated to or associated with the OLF?</span></b></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">It is not our organisation’s view that any Oromo person being returned to Ethiopia
               from the UK would be presumed by the state to be associated with the OLF. As has already
               been noted, there are Oromo people in senior positions in the Ethiopian government,
               including the Prime Minister himself; the region is currently governed by an ethnic
               Oromo party loyal to the national government; and it is policed largely by locally
               recruited police officers and militia members. As such, we do not consider that there
               is a universal presumption of Oromo ethnicity equating to opposition to the government
               generally or support for the OLF specifically.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">That said, we do consider that the circumstances of an Oromo person being forcibly
               returned from the UK to Ethiopia, whether or not the Ethiopian authorities were aware
               that they were being returned as a failed asylum seeker, would be likely to give rise
               to at least some initial suspicion of the individual by the authorities, which could
               in turn prompt some further enquiries and background checks. If these enquiries were
               to reveal a connection to the OLF or other Oromo opposition groups, then the considerations
               relating to risk described in our answers to the questions above would apply.</span></p>
         <p><b><span style="color:#000000"><u>Conclusion</u></span></b></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">Since coming to power in 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has instituted a number of
               important reforms that opened up an opportunity for fundamental human rights change
               in Ethiopia, including the release of political prisoners and the repeal of a range
               of repressive laws. However, a number of areas remain largely or entirely unreformed,
               most pertinently the state security apparatus, which remains politically loyal to
               the governing party and which engages in arbitrary and extremely abusive practices,
               including mass arrests, incommunicado detention, torture and extrajudicial execution.
               At the same time, the government has been confronted by increasing ethnic tensions
               in the country, intercommunal violence and the growing influence of nationalist, self-determination
               and independence movements in various regions of Ethiopia. The government sees these
               movements both as obstacles to its agenda and as potential threats to the territorial
               integrity of the nation.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">The state security apparatus, under the command of the government and with its political
               backing, has engaged in serious human rights abuses across the country, but particularly
               in the Oromia region, which is home to an ambitious and popular nationalist movement
               for self-determination. This security apparatus has used the rise of a relatively
               small armed splinter faction, the OLA, as a pretext for a widespread crackdown on
               supporters and perceived supporters of Oromo nationalism in general and the OLF in
               particular. This crackdown has come in the context of Federal and Regional elections
               that, prior to their suspension due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the OLF were expected
               to do very well in; potentially displacing the political leadership the security services
               have been loyal to since the early 1990s.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">The crackdown has been characterised by extreme brutality, including public extrajudicial
               executions and other forms of extreme arbitrary and indiscriminate violence. Rather
               than focus its efforts on targeting and confronting the relatively small armed splinter
               faction from the OLA, which has undoubtedly committed grave human rights abuses itself,
               the security services have instead focused on civilians in Oromia and suspected OLF
               supporters in particular. Thousands have been arrested and detained for prolonged
               indefinite periods on broad and unparticularised grounds of suspected support for
               terrorism and the OLA. Thousands remain detained to this day.</span></p>
         <p><span style="color:#000000">In this context, it is our organisation’s assessment that the overall risk assessment
               findings of the MB case remain appropriate, and may even be too narrow, even if the
               background justification for them has changed.</span></p>
