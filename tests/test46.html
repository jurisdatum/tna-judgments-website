                     first proceeded on the basis that there was no issue to be tried as to whether or
                     not the Transaction had been terminated, and sought payment of the amount which would
                     have been due even if Phelan was correct in its contention that the trades had proceeded
                     to their maturity date. That application did not proceed to judgment, because Phelan
                     agreed to an order requiring it to pay the amount claimed (US$ 14,719,523.18) within
                     a stipulated time period which has since been extended on an “unless order” basis.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Macquarie brings this further summary judgment application on the basis that, even

                     payment due on 28 May 2021, there was nonetheless an Event of Default and Macquarie
                     was entitled to and did terminate the Transaction on 4 June 2021. On this occasion,
                     therefore, Macquarie invites the court summarily to determine the termination issue
                     in its favour, while accepting that there remains a triable issue as to what the correct
                     strike price is, and to order an interim payment in its favour in an amount equivalent
                     to the Early Termination Amount as it would have been due had the Transaction been
                     on the terms alleged by Phelan (<b>the Alternative Early Termination Amount</b>).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Between 13 and 14 May 2021, there were emails and a telephone call between Macquarie
                     and Phelan about the terms of proposed new trades, in which Macquarie initially proposed
                     a ZAR strike price of 22.05 for the trade due to settle on 28 May 2021 (Macquarie’s
                     email of 13.28 on 13 May 2021). There is a dispute between the parties as to whether
                     that trade was concluded by reference to that strike price, or whether the deal was
                     done by reference to a strike price of 22.16. It is the latter figure which appears
                     in the trade recap email sent by Macquarie to Phelan at 12.44 on 14 May 2021, but
                     the status of that document is in dispute. However, there is no dispute that a swap
                     was concluded on 14 May 2021 for settlement on 28 May 2021 (<b>the 28 May 2021 Settlement Trade</b>).

                     Phelan responded at 15.49 stating “we hereby dispute the amounts stated in the email
                     as being due and correct as we are unable to reconcile the amounts to the fully executed

                     does not solely depend on the language used alone, and there can be an unambiguous
                     communication of information even when the communication in question involves a mistake.

                     Termination Amount is, within certain limits, entitled to quantify the amount of the
                     payment <i>after the debt has arisen</i>. Those limits include the requirement to act “in good faith and use commercially
                     reasonable procedures in order to produce a commercially reasonable result” (which
                     appear in the definition of “close-out amount” in section 14). If no such calculation

                     unquantified or unpayable. As Rix LJ noted of the valuation procedures in <i>Socimer International Bank Ltd v Standard Bank London Ltd (No 2)</i> [2008] EWCA Civ 116 (a case not concerned with either form of ISDA Master Agreement)

                           Macquarie’s case. However, Macquarie’s (assumed) error as to one of the terms of the

                           a new cause of action. It cannot be the case that any dispute as to the terms of a

                           the decision of Mr Knowles QC that pursuant to section 6(d) the sum claimed only became
                           ‘payable’ once <i>adequate details </i>of the sum claimed had been provided … In my judgment that concession was not correct.
                           Likewise I do not agree with the judge's conclusion as set out in paragraph 16, that
                           once ‘sufficient details’ of both the calculation of the sum claimed and of the bank
                           account into which the sum was to be paid ‘the notice is … effective’. The use by
                           the draftsman of the word ‘notice’, in conjunction with the word ‘effective’, in section
                           6(d)(ii) in order to ascertain the Payment Date must, in my judgment, be a reference
                           to the language of section 12 , which expressly addresses the question of the precise
                           day upon which a notice is deemed to be ‘effective’. The words used in section 6(d)
                           (ii) (i.e. ‘on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective’) are not, in
                           my view, addressing a wholly different concept of ‘effectiveness’ – namely the concept
                           that a section 6(d)(i) statement (or notice) can only be ‘effective’ once all the
                           details required to be contained in such a statement are supplied, a date which may
                           be unclear and open to argument. On the contrary, section 6(d)(ii) is referring to
                           when, in accordance with the provisions of section 12 , the notice is ‘effective’,
                           viz. a specific delivery date, identified by the provisions of section 12.

                           appellants' analysis, the obligation to pay such sum never arose, and therefore the
                           Non-defaulting Party had to sue for some entirely different amount, which it might
                           be able to establish at its loss as the result of the Defaulting Party's breach of

                     “effective” in section 6(d)(ii) was addressing the quality of information provided
                     as to the calculation of the Early Termination Amount, saying it was aimed at “a wholly
                     different concept of effectiveness”, namely that dealt with in section 12(a) of the
                     ISDA Master Agreement, which identifies the point in time at which particular forms
                     of notice will be treated as having been received, and effective in that sense. I
                     accept that the passages in bold lend some support to the argument that notice of
                     the amount payable is necessary for the debt to become payable. However, Gloster LJ
                     did not need to consider the legal consequence of a notice which was not properly
                     calculated but which was effectively received. Further, she emphasised the commercial

                     5(b)(v) had been supplemented in that case by an additional termination event for
                     “Russian market events”, with both parties being treated as affected parties and with
                     the “loss” measure to be used in calculating the amounts payable on termination. One
                     party (SG) served a notice of a “Russian market event”, contending that both parties
                     were required to serve their calculation of loss or gain. The parties agreed an early
                     termination date of 24 September 1998, and provided their respective calculations
                     on 1 October 1998. A significant feature of the case was that the net amount payable
                     was dependent on the combined effect of the calculations of <i>both </i>parties. ANZ disputed SG’s calculation, and the court upheld that challenge. A dispute
                     arose as to which interest rate was payable to ANZ, the contractual termination rate
                     or the default rate. SG submitted ([13]):

                           with s. 6(d)(ii) until a notice of the amount payable is effective. But in the present
                           case neither side produced a notice of the amount payable because of the dispute as
                           to how the losses of SG should be calculated. The calculation of SG, even if it is
                           ultimately found to be wrong, was, in the words of the ‘loss’ clause, ‘reasonably
                           determined [by SG] to be its total losses and costs’. Therefore if the parties, in
                           good faith, fail to agree on the amount payable in accordance with s. 6(e), and so
                           no effective notice was produced, then no ‘payment date’ can be determined. Therefore
                           the ‘payment date’ will only arrive upon the court's determination of the proper basis
                           for calculating SG's losses. Until that time SG is not in default and so does not

                           sufficient to render the Early Termination Amount payable in such amount as the court
                           later determines. There are authorities which, in other contexts, have held that notice
                           of a failure to pay a debt will be valid and trigger the obligation to pay even if

                              date on which the amount becomes payable, the amount which must be paid will be known.</span></p>

                           the court must then determine the amount, the machinery for rendering the debt payable
                           has broken down, and is replaced by an obligation to pay the debt within a reasonable
                           time (which would have regard to the point at which the paying party would reasonably
                           be aware of the amount to be paid). There are other commercial contexts in which a
                           <i>debitum in praesentum solvendum in futuro </i>has been held to have become payable in such circumstances: in the charterparty context

However, none of these cases involved the carefully crafted interest
                           regime of the ISDA Master Agreement.

                           the debt which is due payable, even if that has to be done after trial or even after
                           a successful appeal, or in advance on a contingent basis (in the alternative to its
                           primary case that a valid notice has already been served – as Mr Dhillon KC accepted
                           could be done). Given that interest will run in respect of the period before such
                           a notice is served (albeit in some cases at a different rate), it might be said that
                           no significant practical detriment would follow from this approach.

                     into focus meant that there was no sufficient opportunity at the hearing to explore
                     the first two alternatives, and it would not be appropriate to resolve those issues
                     without the benefit of full argument, given their potential impact on such a widely
                     used form. In these circumstances, I have decided to proceed for the purposes of the
                     interim payment application on the basis that Macquarie would only be entitled to
                     obtain a judgment at trial for the Alternative Early Termination Amount if notice
                     of that amount had been served so as to make it clear beyond scope for argument that
                     such an amount was payable (there being no suggestion that this has already been done),
                     albeit without prejudice to its case as to the validity of the notice of the Early
                     Termination Amount it has already given.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first is to suggest that the court cannot be confident that the figure for the
                     Alternative Early Termination Amount as calculated by Macquarie will be recoverable
                     at trial, pointing to the fact that the parties had agreed, and on 4 May 2022, Mr
                     Justice Andrew Baker had ordered the parties, to exchange expert evidence as to the
                     appropriate spot rate which is due to be exchanged on 28 October 2022.

                     it contended that it had used the spot rate most favourable to Phelan, and exhibited
                     the relevant documents. Phelan served no evidence in response. Having failed to answer
                     this aspect of Macquarie’s claim, it cannot now resist an interim payment on the basis
                     that something may come out of the woodwork in the expert evidence. This does not
                     render the order for expert evidence unnecessary because it will still be necessary
                     at trial to determine whether Macquarie is entitled to more than the amount for which
                     it seeks an interim payment.

                     Macquarie had made a “highly material” (but unquantified) gain on a hedging contract
                     it had taken out in relation to its exposure to Phelan, and that it is arguable that
                     such a profit needs to be brought into account when calculating the Alternative Early
                     Payment Amount. In this context, Mr Hobson relied upon the definition of “Close-out
                     Amount”, and in particular the words:

                     However, there was no evidence supporting this figure. In the absence of such evidence,
