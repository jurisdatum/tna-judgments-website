                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I will begin by explaining the wider context to my consideration, which is that London
                           is facing a housing crisis and we urgently need more housing. Particularly, genuinely
                           affordable homes.  Assessed need showed that London needs at least 66,000 new homes
                           a year until 2030, 3,000 of which must be affordable in order to address the existing
                           shortfall in housing and accommodate London’s projected population growth.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have made fixing the housing crisis one of my top priorities and achieving this
                           is dependent on the approval of well-designed schemes with good levels of low-cost
                           rented and other genuinely affordable housing. This needs to be understood not just
                           by the government, but at local council level too. We must all ensure that we use
                           appropriate opportunities that are available to us to build more affordable housing,
                           particularly lower-cost rental housing.

                           still has a long way to go to deliver the affordable housing targets as set out in
                           the London Plan. The scheme that I am considering would provide 121 new London affordable
                           rent homes and 61 shared ownership homes to people who desperately need them in Hillingdon,
                           all of which would be genuinely affordable.

                           station. It is exactly the kind of site we need to intensify if we are to deliver
                           the homes Londoners need whilst protecting the Green Belt. The council’s own policy
                           allocates this site for residential development.

                           [area] and significant areas of new and improved green space, which would be of considerable
                           benefit to local people. It would also provide new commercial uses and improve connections,
                           which would benefit the local centre.

                           GAL<i> </i>[<i>sic</i>] and council officers that there would be less than substantial harm to heritage
                           assets, which would be out-weighed by the benefits of the scheme.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Whilst the scale and prominence would be apparent in some local views, this would
                           not in my view be a harmful impact given the approach the massing and high-quality
                           architecture, and would not harm the visual openness of the surrounding Green Belt.
                           I recognise that the site is not within a location designated to tall buildings. But
                           overall, I consider the height and massing to be acceptable.

                           form of development will ensure that future residents will not be disadvantaged, subject
                           to the mitigation measures recommended.

                           the shortfall against local policy. I have heard the concerns raised about the lack
                           of car parking and the increase in traffic congestion. In my view, when considering
                           development proposals, the main way to reduce congestion is to discourage the use
                           of the private car.

                           However, there are some areas where tall buildings don’t reflect the local character.
                           I believe boroughs should be empowered to choose where tall buildings are built within

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In respect of tall buildings policy, the Update Report identified that Policy D9 of
                     the London Plan 2021 should now be given full statutory weight (paragraph 21) and
                     that the Secretary of State’s direction “primarily sought to ensure that tall buildings
                     are only brought forward in appropriate and clearly defined areas as determined by
                     the boroughs” (paragraph 13). It went on to identify that as a consequence “there
                     is now a further element of conflict with the development plan in that the scheme
                     does not fully accord with new London Plan Policy D9”. Nevertheless, the Update Report
                     gave significant weight to the fact that the proposals would however comply with the
                     other criteria in Policy D9 (paragraphs 16 and 22). It advised that a conflict with
                     some development plan policies does not necessarily mean that there is an overall
                     conflict with the development plan as a whole, as policies can pull in different directions
                     (paragraph 17). The Update Report identified additional conflicts with the London
                     Plan and Local Plan policies in respect of heritage, but concluded that the less than
                     substantial harm was outweighed by the public benefits of the development. At paragraph
                     23, the Update Report concluded that “overall, the proposal accords” with the development
                     plan. None of the material considerations, as set out in the Hearing Report and the
                     Update Report, warranted refusal of planning permission.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By virtue of section 18A the development plan is no longer simply one of the material
                           considerations. Its provisions, provided that they are relevant to the particular
                           application, are to govern the decision unless there are material considerations which
                           indicate that in the particular case the provisions of the plan should not be followed.
                           If it is thought to be useful to talk of presumptions in this field, it can be said
                           that there is now a presumption that the development plan is to govern the decision
                           on an application for planning permission….. By virtue of section 18A if the application
                           accords with the development plan and there are no material considerations indicating
                           that it should be refused, permission should be granted. If the application does not
                           accord with the development plan it will be refused unless there are material considerations
                           indicating that it should be granted….

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Moreover the section has not touched the well-established distinction in principle
                           between those matters which are properly within the jurisdiction of the decision-maker
                           and those matters in which the court can properly intervene. It has introduced a requirement
                           with which the decision-maker must comply, namely the recognition of the priority
                           to be given to the development plan. It has thus introduced a potential ground on
                           which the decision-maker could be faulted were he to fail to give effect to that requirement.
                           But beyond that it still leaves the assessment of the facts and the weighing of the
                           considerations in the hands of the decision-maker. It is for him to assess the relative
                           weight to be given to all the material considerations. It is for him to decide what
                           weight is to be given to the development plan, recognising the priority to be given
                           to it. As Glidewell L.J. observed in <i>Loup v. Secretary of State for the Environment </i>(1995) 71 P. &amp; C.R. 175, 186:

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the practical application of section 18A it will obviously be necessary for the
                           decision-maker to consider the development plan, identify any provisions in it which
                           are relevant to the question before him and make a proper interpretation of them.
                           His decision will be open to challenge if he fails to have regard to a policy in the
                           development plan which is relevant to the application or fails properly to interpret
                           it. He will also have to consider whether the development proposed in the application
                           before him does or does not accord with the development plan. There may be some points
                           in the plan which support the proposal but there may be some considerations pointing
                           in the opposite direction. He will require to assess all of these and then decide
                           whether in light of the whole plan the proposal does or does not accord with it. He
                           will also have to identify all the other material considerations which are relevant
                           to the application and to which he should have regard. He will then have to note which
                           of them support the application and which of them do not, and he will have to assess
                           the weight to be given to all of these considerations. He will have to decide whether
                           there are considerations of such weight as to indicate that the development plan should
                           not be accorded the priority which the statute has given to it. And having weighed
                           these considerations and determined these matters he will require to form his opinion
                           on the disposal of the application. If he fails to take account of some material consideration
                           or takes account of some consideration which is irrelevant to the application his
                           decision will be open to challenge. But the assessment of the considerations can only
                           be challenged on the ground that it is irrational or perverse.”

                           or contractual provisions. Although a development plan has a legal status and legal
                           effects, it is not analogous in its nature or purpose to a statute or a contract.
                           As has often been observed, development plans are full of broad statements of policy,
                           many of which may be mutually irreconcilable, so that in a particular case one must
                           give way to another. In addition, many of the provisions of development plans are
                           framed in language whose application to a given set of facts requires the exercise
                           of judgment. Such matters fall within the jurisdiction of planning authorities, and
                           their exercise of their judgment can only be challenged on the ground that it is irrational
                           or perverse (<i>Tesco Stores Ltd v. Secretary of State for the Environment</i> [1995] 1 WLR 659, 780 per Lord Hoffmann).”

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">21.&nbsp; First, the&nbsp;section 38(6)&nbsp;duty is a duty to make a decision (or “determination”)
                           by giving the development plan priority, but weighing all other material considerations
                           in the balance to establish whether the decision should be made, as the statute presumes,
                           in accordance with the plan (see Lord Clyde's speech in <i>City of Edinburgh Council</i>, at p.1458D to p.1459A, and p.1459D-G). Secondly, therefore, the decision-maker must
                           understand the relevant provisions of the plan, recognizing that they may sometimes
                           pull in different directions (see Lord Clyde's speech in City of Edinburgh Council
                           , at p.1459D-F, the judgments of Lord Reed and Lord Hope in&nbsp;<i>Tesco Stores Ltd. v Dundee City Council </i>[2012] UKSC 13, respectively at paragraphs 19 and 34, and the judgment of Sullivan
                           J., as he then was, in&nbsp;<i>R. v Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council, ex p. Milne</i> [2001] J.P.L. 470, at paragraphs 48 to 50). Thirdly,&nbsp;section 38(6)&nbsp;does not prescribe
                           the way in which the decision-maker is to go about discharging the duty. It does not
                           specify, for all cases, a two-stage exercise, in which, first, the decision-maker
                           decides “whether the development plan should or should not be accorded its statutory
                           priority”, and secondly, “if he decides that it should not be given that priority
                           it should be put aside and attention concentrated upon the material factors which
                           remain for consideration” (see Lord Clyde's speech in City of Edinburgh Council ,
                           at p.1459H to p.1460D). Fourthly, however, the duty can only be properly performed
                           if the decision-maker, in the course of making the decision, establishes whether or
                           not the proposal accords with the development plan as a whole (see the judgment of
                           Richards L.J. in&nbsp;<i>R. (on the application of Hampton Bishop Parish Council) v Herefordshire Council </i>[2014] EWCA Civ 878, at paragraph 28, and the judgment of Patterson J. in&nbsp;<i>Tiviot Way Investments Ltd. v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government
                              </i>[2015] EWHC 2489 (Admin)&nbsp; at paragraphs 27 to 36). And fifthly, the duty under&nbsp;section
                           38(6)&nbsp;is not displaced or modified by government policy in the NPPF. Such policy does
                           not have the force of statute. Nor does it have the same status in the statutory scheme
                           as the development plan. Under&nbsp;section 70(2)&nbsp;of the 1990 Act and&nbsp;section 38(6)&nbsp;of
                           the 2004 Act, its relevance to a planning decision is as one of the other material
                           considerations to be weighed in the balance (see the judgment of Richards L.J. in
                           <i>Hampton Bishop Parish Council</i>, at paragraph 30).”

                           court will not disturb: see the speech of Lord Hoffmann in <i>Tesco </i> <i>Stores Ltd v Secretary of State for the Environment </i>[1005] 1 WLR 759, 780.  The interpretation of development plan policy, however, is
                           ultimately a matter of law for the court. The court does not approach that task with
                           the same linguistic rigour as it applies to the construction of a statute or contract.
                           It must seek to discern from the language used in formulating the plan the sensible
                           meaning of the policies in question, in their full context, and thus their true effect.
                           The context includes the objectives to which the policies are directed, other relevant
                           policies in the plan, and the relevant supporting text. The court will always keep
                           in mind that the creation of development plan policy by a local planning authority
                           is not an end in itself, but a means to the end of coherent and reasonably predictable
                           decision-making, in the public interest (see the judgment of Lord Reed in&nbsp;<i>Tesco v Dundee City Council</i>, at paragraphs 18 and 19; the judgment of Lord Gill in&nbsp;<i>Hopkins Homes</i>, at paragraphs 72 and 73; the judgment of Richards L.J. in&nbsp;<i>Ashburton Trading Ltd. v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government </i>[2014] EWCA Civ 378, at paragraphs 17 and 24; and the judgment of Richards L.J. in&nbsp;<i>R.

                           is not to be elevated into a formal requirement that in every case where a new material
                           consideration arises after the passing of a resolution (in principle) to grant planning
                           permission but before the issue of the decision notice there has to be a specific
                           referral of the application back to committee. In my judgment the duty is discharged
                           if, as at the date at which the decision notice is issued, the authority has considered
                           all material considerations affecting the application, and has done so with the application
                           in mind — albeit that the application was not specifically placed before it for reconsideration.

                           do so, the authority will be in breach of its statutory duty.

                           be regarded as a “material consideration” for the purposes of section 70(2), it must
                           be a counsel of prudence for the delegated officer to err on the side of caution and
                           refer the application back to the authority for specific reconsideration in the light
                           of that new factor. In such circumstances the delegated officer can only safely proceed

                                 that they are written for councillors with local knowledge (see the judgment of Baroness

                                 it may reasonably be assumed that, if the members followed the officer’s recommendation,
                                 they did so on the basis of the advice that he or she gave (see the judgment of Lewison

                                 on a fair reading of the report as a whole, the officer has materially misled the
                                 members on a matter bearing upon their decision, and the error has gone uncorrected
                                 before the decision was made. Minor or inconsequential errors may be excused. It is
                                 only if the advice in the officer’s report is such as to misdirect the members in
                                 a material way – so that, but for the flawed advice it was given, the committee’s
                                 decision would or might have been different – that the court will be able to conclude

                                 advice was given, and on the possible consequences of it. There will be cases in which
                                 a planning officer has inadvertently led a committee astray by making some significant

                           letters, it is well established that, in construing the latter, it has to be remembered
                           that they are addressed to the parties who will be well aware of the issues that have
                           been raised in the appeal. They are thus addressed to a knowledgeable readership and
                           the adequacy of their reasoning must be considered against that background. That approach
                           applies with particular force to a planning officer's report to a committee. Its purpose
                           is not to decide the issue, but to inform the members of the relevant considerations
                           relating to the application. It is not addressed to the world at large but to council
                           members who, by virtue of that membership, may be expected to have substantial local
                           and background knowledge. There would be no point in a planning officer's report setting
                           out in great detail background material, for example, in respect of local topography,
                           development planning policies or matters of planning history if the members were only
                           too familiar with that material. Part of a planning officer's expert function in reporting
                           to the committee must be to make an assessment of how much information needs to be
                           included in his or her report in order to avoid burdening a busy committee with excessive
                           and unnecessary detail.”

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Policy D9 Part A states that the definition of “what is considered a tall building
                           for specific localities” is a matter for individual boroughs through their local development
                           plan. The only limit on that planning judgment is that the definition of a tall building
                           is subject to a “floor” of 6 storeys or 18 metres. When arriving at this definition,
                           it is implicit that a borough planning authority will need to consider the potential
                           impacts of buildings of different heights in specific localities: that this is the
                           case is supported by paragraph 3.9.3 in the supporting text [CB/E5] which elucidates
                           what is meant by buildings being “tall” by reference to their relative height compared
                           to “their surroundings” and their impact on the skyline.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Policy D9 Part B, paragraph 1 is linked to Part A in so far as in addition to determining
                           what a tall building is in planning policy terms, boroughs are given the sole responsibility
                           for determining “if there are locations where tall buildings may be an appropriate
                           form of development” within their area i.e. in specific localities. Boroughs are not
                           obliged to identify any such locations, nor is there a presumption that at least one
                           area of a borough will be appropriate. The matter is left entirely to the planning
                           judgment of the borough through the development plan process. Moreover, even in areas
                           identified, there is no presumption that tall buildings will be consented, because,
                           as paragraph 3.9.3 explains (building on Policy D9 Part B paragraph 1) “such proposals
                           will still need to be assessed in the context of other planning policies… to ensure
                           that they are appropriate for their location and do not lead to unacceptable impacts”.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When deciding whether and where tall buildings “may be an appropriate form of development”,
                           boroughs will necessarily have to take into account the impacts of buildings of defined
                           heights or features. This is obviously implicit in the word “appropriate” (referring
                           to the appropriateness of the form of development given the particular characteristic
                           of the locality) and “suitable” (in Policy D9 Part B paragraph 3, referring to the
                           suitability of a particular locality <i>for tall buildings</i> given its particular characteristics and the impact of tall building on them). The
                           supporting text at paragraph 3.9.2(1) supports this interpretation (that boroughs
                           necessarily have to take into account impacts of potential development) since it instructs
                           boroughs to identify locations “by assessing potential visual and cumulative impacts”.
                           That impact assessment is intrinsic to appropriateness is also reflected in paragraph
                           3.9.1 of the supporting text, which recognises that tall buildings can “have detrimental
                           visual, functional and environmental impacts <u>if in inappropriate locations</u>” (underlining added).

                           by boroughs under Part A and Part B paragraph 1, by stating in clear terms that tall
                           buildings (as defined in Part A) “should only be developed in locations that are identified
                           as suitable in Development Plans” by boroughs under Part B. In this case it is not
                           in dispute that the only areas identified as suitable for tall buildings in Policy
                           DMHB10 LP DMP are Uxbridge and Hayes town centres, which identification was justified

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Policy D9 Part C …. then requires “development proposals” to satisfactorily address
                           a number of stipulated impacts, grouped into categories (visual, functional, environmental,
                           and cumulative). Some of these impacts are familiar because they include some (visual
                           and cumulative) that boroughs will have already had regard to when determining the
                           heights/localities appropriateness/suitability question. The term “development proposals”
                           does not mean <i>any </i>development proposal of <i>any </i>type: it has to be read in the context of Policy D9 as a whole, and thus logically
                           in line with Parts A and B which precede it, and the assessment process at local plan
                           level that is contemplated by those two parts (and explained further in the supporting
                           text). Thus the “development proposals” which must address the stipulated impacts
                           can only be understood to mean development proposals (i) for tall buildings as defined
                           by boroughs under Part A (as explained in paragraph 3.9.3, “this policy applies to
                           tall buildings as defined by the borough”….; and (ii) in locations identified as suitable
                           by boroughs under Part B. Part C of the process for tall building regulation in London
                           requires further examination of the detail of particular proposals that have come
                           forward in compliance with Parts A and B: this is (amongst other things) what paragraph
                           3.9.3 of the supporting text is referring to when it speaks of “such proposals [i.e.
                           proposals in areas identified as suitable] will still need to be assessed in the context
                           of other planning policies… to ensure that they are appropriate for their location

                           are acceptable in terms of the criteria set out in Part C. It could not sensibly be

                           Hearing Report. That policy did not provide any wording to compare with the “Definition”
                           and “Locations” parts of Policy D9 and the allocation of responsibility to local planning
                           authorities in those regards but, under the then heading “Planning decisions”, set

                           when reading the condition in the context of the other conditions and of the consent
                           as a whole. This is an objective exercise in which the court will have regard to the
                           natural and ordinary meaning of the relevant words, the overall purpose of the consent,
                           any other conditions which cast light on the purpose of the relevant words, and common
                           sense. Whether the court may also look at other documents that are connected with
                           the application for the consent or are referred to in the consent will depend on the
                           circumstances of the case, in particular the wording of the document that it is interpreting.
                           Other documents may be relevant if they are incorporated into the consent by reference
                           (as in condition 7 set out in para 38 below) or there is an ambiguity in the consent,
                           which can be resolved, for example, by considering the application for consent.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I was referred to the judgment of Lindblom J. (as he then was) in <i>R (Phides Estates (Overseas) Ltd) v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</i> [2015] EWHC 827 (Admin), at [56]:

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“I do not think it is necessary, or appropriate, to resort to other documents to help
                           with the interpretation of Policy SS2. In the first place, the policy is neither obscure
                           nor ambiguous. Secondly, the material on which Mr Edwards seeks to rely is not part
                           of the core strategy. It is all extrinsic – though at least some of the documents
                           constituting the evidence base for the core strategy are mentioned in its policies,
                           text and appendices, and are listed in a table in Appendix 6. Thirdly, as Mr Moules
                           and Mr Brown submit, when the court is faced with having to construe a policy in an
                           adopted plan it cannot be expected to rove through the background documents to the
                           plan's preparation, delving into such of their content as might seem relevant. One
                           would not expect a landowner or a developer or a member of the public to have to do
                           that to gain an understanding of what the local planning authority had had in mind
                           when it framed a particular policy in the way that it did.&nbsp;Unless there is a particular
                           difficulty in construing a provision in the plan, which can only be resolved by going
                           to another document either incorporated into the plan or explicitly referred to in
                           it, I think one must look only to the contents of the plan itself, read fairly as
                           a whole. To do otherwise would be to neglect what Lord Reed said in paragraph 18 of
                           his judgment in <i>Tesco Stores Ltd. v Dundee City Council</i> : that “[the] development plan is a carefully drafted and considered statement of
                           policy, published in order to inform the public of the approach which will be followed
                           by planning authorities in decision-making unless there is good reason to depart from
                           it”, that the plan is “intended to guide the behaviour of developers and planning
                           authorities”, and that “the policies which it sets out are designed to secure consistency
                           and direction in the exercise of discretionary powers, while allowing a measure of
                           flexibility to be retained”. In my view, to enlarge the task of construing a policy
                           by requiring a multitude of other documents to be explored in the pursuit of its meaning
                           would be inimical to the interests of clarity, certainty and consistency in the “plan-led
                           system”. As Lewison L.J. said in paragraph 14 of his judgment in&nbsp;<i>R. (on the application of TW Logistics Ltd.) v Tendring District Council</i> [2013] EWCA Civ 9, with which Mummery and Aikens L.JJ. agreed, “this kind of forensic
                           archaeology is inappropriate to the interpretation of a document like a local plan
                           …”. The “public nature” of such a document is, as he said (at paragraph 15), “of critical
                           importance”. The public are, in principle, entitled to rely on it “as it stands, without
                           having to investigate its provenance and evolution”.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All parties contended that the meaning of Policy D9 was clear and unambiguous, despite
                     the differences in their interpretation of it. In those circumstances, applying the
                     principles set out above, I consider that I ought not to have regard to the letter
                     from the Secretary of State to the Defendant dated 10 December 2020 (paragraph 46
                     above) as it is not a public document which members of the public could reasonably
                     be expected to access when reading Policy D9.  Furthermore, it is of limited value
                     as, taken at its highest, it sets out the Secretary of State’s intentions, whereas
                     the Court must consider the meaning of the words actually used in Policy D9, as amended
                     by DR12, which in my view did not give effect to the expressed intentions in the letter.
                     However, I do consider that it is appropriate to have regard to the ITP draft London
                     Plan Policy D9, which was referred to in the Hearing Report, and the Secretary of
                     State’s Direction which is in the public domain and was referenced in the Update Report,
                     and the introduction to the London Plan 2021.  This demonstrates the differences between
                     the ITP draft version of Policy D9, on the basis of which the initial decision to
                     grant planning permission was granted, and the final version of Policy D9, following
                     the Secretary of State’s direction, on the basis of which the reconsideration decision
                     was made.

                           of the word “suitable” to Part B(3).  It did not add any text which supports or assists
                           the Claimant’s interpretation, even though the Secretary of State had the opportunity

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my view, the context is critical to the interpretation.  Policy D9 is a planning
                     policy in a development plan.  By section 70(2) TCPA 1990 and section 38(6) PCPA 2004,
                     there is a presumption that a determination will be made in accordance with the plan,
                     unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  Thus, the decision-maker “will
                     have to decide whether there are considerations of such weight as to indicate that
                     the development plan should not be accorded the priority which the statute has given
                     to it”: per Lord Clyde in <i>City of Edinburgh</i> at 1459G. Furthermore, the decision-maker must understand the relevant provisions
                     of the plan “recognising that they may sometimes pull in different directions”: per
                     Lindblom LJ in <i>BDW Trading Ltd </i>at [21], and extensive authorities there cited in support of that proposition. As
                     Lord Reed explained in <i>Tesco Stores Ltd v Dundee City Council</i>, “development plans are full of broad statements of policy, many of which may be
                     mutually irreconcilable, so that in a particular case one must give way to another”.

                     must have been aware of these fundamental legal principles, and therefore that it
                     was possible that the policy in paragraph B(3) might not be followed, in any particular
                     determination, if it was outweighed by other policies in the development plan, or
                     by material considerations.  It seems likely that policy provision was made for such
                     cases, given the importance of the issue.

                     it would surely be sensible, and in accordance with the objectives of Policy D9, for
                     the proposal to be assessed by reference to the potential impacts which are listed
                     in Part C.  The Claimant’s interpretation leads to the absurd result that a decision-maker
                     in those circumstances is not permitted to have regard to Part C, and must assess
                     the impacts of the proposal in a vacuum.

                     B.  Notwithstanding the non-compliance with Part B of Policy D9, the Defendant determined
                     that the proposal accorded with the provisions of the development plan when read as
                     a whole. That was a planning judgment, based on the benefits of the proposal, such
                     as the contribution of much-needed housing, in particular affordable housing, and
                     the suitability of the Site (brownfield and sustainable, with good transport).  The

                     account of the Claimant’s evidence on the air quality impacts of the proposed development.
                     Rather, on the advice of GLA officers, the Defendant exercised his planning judgment
                     to conclude that the development would comply with relevant policy in respect of air
                     quality impacts, and that additional mitigation in the form of a “damage cost”<i> </i>payment was not justified. That was a legitimate exercise of planning judgment which
                     discloses no error of law, particularly in circumstances where the Claimant had previously
                     agreed that no such payment was required.

                     reports, such reports should be read benevolently and without undue rigour (<i>Mansell, </i>per Lindblom LJ at [42]), bearing in mind that it is part of a planning officer's
                     expert function to make an assessment of how much information needs to be included
                     in his or her report.  On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that the specialist
                     air quality officers at the GLA will have considered the AQE Report and Create’s Technical
                     Note in response to it.  Ultimately, the GLA officers and the Defendant preferred

                           considerable time and are derived from the decision of Hodgson J in <i>R v Brent London Borough Council ex p Gunning</i> (1985) 84 LGR 168. They are, firstly, that the consultation should be undertaken
                           at a time when the proposals are still at a formative stage. Secondly, the body undertaking
                           the consultation should provide sufficient reasons and explanation for the decision
                           about which it is consulting to enable the consultees to provide a considered and
                           informed response. Thirdly, adequate time to allow for consideration and response
                           must be provided. Fourthly, the responses to the consultation must be conscientiously
                           taken into account in reaching the decision about which the public body is consulting.
                           These principles, known as the Sedley criteria as a result of the author of the submissions
                           upon which they were based, have recently been endorsed by the Supreme Court in&nbsp;<i>R(Moseley) v Haringey London Borough Council </i>[2014] UKSC 56; [2014] 1 WLR 3947&nbsp;at paragraph 26.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">66.&nbsp; In his judgment in Moseley Lord Wilson JSC emphasised that however the duty to
                           consult arises, the manner in which it is conducted will be informed by the common
                           law requirements of fairness.&nbsp;He observed at paragraph 24 as follows:
                        </p>
                        <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>
                              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“Fairness is a protean concept, not susceptible of much generalised enlargement. But
                                 its requirements in this context must be linked to the purposes of consultation. In&nbsp;<i>R(Osborn) v Parole Board </i>[2014] AC 1115, this court addressed the common law duty of procedural fairness in
                                 the determination of the person's legal rights. Nevertheless the first two of the
                                 purposes of procedural fairness in that somewhat different context, identified by
                                 Lord Reed JSC in paras 67 and 68 of his judgment, equally underlie the requirement
                                 that a consultation should be fair. First, that requirement “is liable to result in
                                 better decisions, by ensuring that the decision-maker receives all relevant information
                                 and that it is properly tested”: para 67. Second, it avoids “the sense of injustice
                                 which the person who is the subject of the decision will otherwise feel”: para 68.
                                 Such are two valuable practical consequences of fair consultation. But underlying
                                 it is also a third purpose, reflective of the democratic principle at the heart of
                                 our society. This third purpose is particularly relevant in a case like the present,
                                 in which the question was not: ‘yes or no, should we close this particular care home,
                                 this particular school etc?’ It was: ‘Required as we are, to make a taxation-related
                                 scheme for application to all the inhabitants of our borough, should we make one in
                                 the terms which we here propose?’”

                           and the purpose of the particular statutory duty to consult and less on the common
                           law duty to act fairly. In paragraph 36 of his judgment, having noted that the case
                           under consideration was not one where the duty to consult arose as a result of a legitimate
                           expectation he stated:

                                 statutory duty of consultation. Such duties vary greatly depending on the particular
                                 provisions in question, the particular context, and the purpose for which the consultation
                                 is to be carried out. The duty may, for example, arise before or after a proposal
                                 has been decided upon; it may be obligatory or may be at the discretion of the public
                                 authority; it may be restricted to particular consultees or may involve the general
                                 public; the identity of the consultees may be prescribed or may be left to the discretion
                                 of the public authority; the consultation may take the form of seeking views in writing,
                                 or holding public meetings; and so on and so forth…”

                           in relation to local government finance which affected its residents generally (the
                           case centred on the authority's decision in relation to a revised scheme for council
                           tax benefits) Lord Reed concluded that the purpose of the statutory duty to consult
                           in that case was “to ensure public participation in the local authority's decision-making
                           process”. He went on to observe in paragraph 39:

                              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“In order for the consultation to achieve that objective, it must fulfil certain minimum
                                 requirements. Meaningful public participation in this particular decision-making process,
                                 in a context with which the general public cannot be expected to be familiar, requires
                                 that the consultees should be provided not only with information about the draft scheme,
                                 but also with an outline of the realistic alternatives, and an indication of the main
                                 reasons for the authority's adoption of the draft scheme.”

                                 and that, as he puts it, in the particular statutory context the duty of the local
                                 authority was to ensure public participation in the decision-making process. It seems
                                 to us that in order to do so it must act fairly by taking the specific steps set out
                                 by Lord Reed JSC, in para 39. In these circumstances we can we think safely agree

                           may be structured and carried out. As Sullivan J (as he then was) observed in <i>R(on the application of Greenpeace Limited) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</i> [2007] EWHC 311 at paragraphs 62 and 63:

                                 is not necessarily so procedurally unfair as to be unlawful. With the benefit of hindsight
                                 it will almost invariably be possible to suggest ways in which a consultation exercise
                                 might have been improved upon. That is most emphatically not the test. It must also
                                 be recognised that a decision-maker will usually have a broad discretion as to how
                                 a consultation exercise should be carried out…In reality, a conclusion that a consultation
                                 exercise was unlawful on the ground of unfairness will be based upon a finding by
                                 the court, not merely that something went wrong, but that something went ‘clearly

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, in the circumstances of this case, fairness required that the Claimant
                     should have been given an opportunity to make representations on the developments
                     which gave rise to the re-consideration, before the GLA officers made their recommendation
                     to the Mayor, and before the Mayor made his re-determination.  This was a development
                     proposal of strategic importance, the Claimant is the local planning authority and
                     it had been a key participant throughout.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant did comply with these requirements.  The Claimant was given an opportunity
                     to make written representations before the Update Report and its Addendum were issued
                     and before the Mayor made the re-determination.

                     before it submitted its further representations.  I do not agree.  It is clear from
                     the Claimant’s cogent letters of 26 February, 4 March and 9 March 2021, and its detailed
                     written representations, that it was well aware of the issues to be addressed, and
                     did so effectively.

                     evidence, and the issues of planning policy and the planning balance to be considered
                     were better suited to written representations, because of their detail and complexity.
                     Members of the public, who might have struggled to make written representations, were
                     not invited to participate in the re-consideration.   Mr Rodger, Deputy Director Planning
                     and Regeneration, who had already made oral representations at the previous hearing,
                     was well able to draft written representations on behalf of the Claimant.

                     was a response to the AQE Report submitted by the Claimant.  The Claimant could then
                     have commented upon it in its own representations to the Defendant, if it wished to
                     do so.  The failure to disclose was procedurally unfair and unlawful.

                     The effect of that provision is that the court must refuse to grant relief if it appears
                     to the court to be highly likely that the outcome for the Claimant would not have
                     been substantially different if the conduct complained of had not occurred.

                     is the decision of the Defendant to grant planning permission.  The issue is whether,
                     had the Claimant been provided with the Technical Note, so that the Claimant had the
                     opportunity to consider it and make further submissions in advance of the decision,
