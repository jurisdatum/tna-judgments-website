A mixed partnership arises where a partnership includes at least one individual partner and one non-individual partner, such as a limited company or other corporate entity.  </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_2"><span class="judgment-body__number">2.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The partnership rules include section 850C. One effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) to increase the profit share of an individual partner who has the power to enjoy the profit share of the corporate partner, if other conditions are satisfied. In these circumstances, HMRC is required to reallocate so much of the profit share of the corporate partner to the individual partner’s power to enjoy to the extent this is just and reasonable.<i> </i>The purpose of the rule is to prevent individual partners making arrangements which seek to accumulate profits in a corporate partner at a lower tax rate – for example, benefitting from the rate of corporation tax which is lower than the higher or additional rate of income tax.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_3"><span class="judgment-body__number">3.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In this case, Mr Walewski (or the “Appellant”) and Walewski Limited (“W Ltd”) were both partners in two LLP partnerships: Alken Asset Management LLP (“AAM”) and Alken Finance LLP (“AF”). The Appellant was an individual partner and W Ltd was a non-individual or corporate partner. W Ltd was a UK company of which the Appellant was a sole director and employee. Partners of the LLPs in this case are also referred to as members.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_4"><span class="judgment-body__number">4.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">HMRC charged the Appellant to income tax for the 2014-15 tax year under section 850C ITTOIA on the basis that the Appellant’s profit share from AAM and AF should be increased by reference to the whole of the profit shares which had originally been allocated to W Ltd.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_5"><span class="judgment-body__number">5.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The assessments were made by HMRC under section 850C ITTOIA by way of two closure notices, each dated 31 March 2017, in which the partnership statements of the LLPs were amended with the result that:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(1)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">£18,088,195 of profits from AAM were reallocated to the Appellant giving rise to total profits chargeable to income tax in his hands of £18,103,962; and</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(2)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">£1,372,510 of profits from AF were reallocated to the Appellant giving rise to total profits chargeable to income tax in his hands of £1,434,315.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_6"><span class="judgment-body__number">6.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Appellant appealed the amendments in the closure notices to the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”). He contended that the additional profits of the two partnerships, amounting to £19,460,705, should not be re-allocated to him because they were earned by W Ltd as a corporate partner and not by him in his capacity as an individual partner in AAM or AF. The majority of these profits were allocated to W Ltd from AAM. The remaining, much smaller amount (£1,372,510),&nbsp;was allocated to W Ltd from AF.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_7"><span class="judgment-body__number">7.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The FTT dismissed the Appellant’s appeal in a decision released on 30 January 2020.  An amended decision was released on 21 April 2020 (the “Decision”). The FTT found that the profit share from the partnerships was not earned by W Ltd but was allocated to W Ltd because of the Appellant’s ability to enjoy those profits via an offshore trust to which W Ltd paid its profits and of which the Appellant’s children were beneficiaries. It found that the whole of W Ltd’s profit share was attributable to the Appellant’s power to enjoy its profits and that it was just and reasonable to reallocate all of W Ltd’s profits to the Appellant.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_8"><span class="judgment-body__number">8.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Appellant sought to appeal the Decision to the Upper Tribunal on two grounds. On 21 April 2020, the FTT granted the Appellant permission to appeal on the first ground of appeal.

It was submitted that the FTT erred in finding that section 850C ITTOIA could apply to such a time period.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_10"><span class="judgment-body__number">10.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second ground of appeal (“Ground 2”) is premised on the FTT’s findings at [170] to [172] of the Decision that the Appellant’s work for W Ltd, AAM and AF was fungible, he was playing only a single role for the benefit of all three entities, and there was “no commercial, physical or temporal separation of [the Appellant’s] activities”. The Appellant submits that the inevitable consequence of these findings is that the FTT erred in allocating all of W Ltd’s profits to the Appellant for the relevant period. There should have been an equal division of W Ltd’s profits (excluding the amounts which could not be reallocated in any case).</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_11"><span class="judgment-body__number">11.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We consider these grounds of appeal in turn below, in Sections D and E. Before we do so, however, it is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions (which we do in Section B) and explain how those provisions were applied by HMRC and found to apply by the FTT (which we do in Section C). In a number of respects, the Appellant accepted the approach of HMRC as considered by the FTT (or at least did not seek to appeal the FTT’s decision in these respects), but it is nevertheless necessary to understand the overall approach in order properly to understand Ground 1 and Ground 2.</p></div></section></section><section><p><b>B.</b><b>THE RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS</b></p><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_12"><span class="judgment-body__number">12.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The profits or losses of an LLP that carries on a business with a view to profit are allocated between the partners according to their agreed partnership interests.

Essentially, the contention was that, on a proper analysis of section 850C, the power to reallocate profit share to the Appellant could <u>only</u> arise in respect of a time period during which he (and W Ltd) were <u>both</u> partners of AAM.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_28"><span class="judgment-body__number">28.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Paragraph 11 of the Appellant’s written submissions put the point thus:</p></div></section><section><p>“Under Ground 1 the Appellant contends that to the extent W Ltd’s profit share was attributable to the period of time when the Appellant was not a partner of AAM, the profits cannot have been reallocated to him. Section 850C envisages cases where individual partners divert their share of profits arising from an LLP to a partner that is a company, and this is relevant because an individual cannot divert that which he does not have to divert in the first place. In other words, to the extent that W Ltd’s profit share relates to the period when the Appellant was not a member of AAM, the profits were those of the then member (i.e. excluding the Appellant) and thus they could not have been diverted by the Appellant to W Ltd. The FTT should either have held (a) that the legislation simply did not apply to such profits, or alternatively (b) that such profits could not be reallocated pursuant to section 850C(4).”</p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_29"><span class="judgment-body__number">29.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The difficulty with this contention is that is assumes a direct correlation between a person’s status as partner and the allocation to that person of the profits in the partnership. In short, the underlying assumption is that there is a direct relationship between the time spent by a person as a partner and the profit share accruing to that partner.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_30"><span class="judgment-body__number">30.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is, we consider, no such correlation. Indeed, that was demonstrated by the various different measures that Mr Soares, on behalf of the Appellant, articulated as to how the profits of AAM might be split as between the Appellant and W Ltd based purely on their time of service as partners during the relevant accounting period.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_31"><span class="judgment-body__number">31.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We consider that there is no necessary correlation between profit share and time served, and that – absent very clear wording in the statute – the proposition advanced by Mr Soares is an untenable one. Indeed, it would open the way to a clear ability to divert partnership profits and undermine the purpose of section 850C by appropriately timing the entry and exit of partners.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_32"><span class="judgment-body__number">32.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We accordingly reject Ground 1.

More specifically:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(1)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The construction contended for would involve doing violence to the clear language of section 850C and/or inserting further words.

Absent any words of limitation, it applies if the various conditions are met at any point in the period of account. As a matter of construction, there is no requirement that A be a partner for more than a moment of time within the relevant period of account for the purposes of section 850C, so long as A receives a share of some profit (see subsection (1)(a)(ii)). </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(3)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This is consistent with the scheme of the legislation: section 850(1) (allocating a firm’s share of profits (or losses) between partners) is subject to section 850C. Section 850A applies for a “period of account”. It is therefore consistent for section 850C to apply for that same period of account, in this case from 6 April 2014 until the dissolution of the partnership on 29 November 2014.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(4)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This approach is also consistent with the scheme of section 850C itself, which is concerned with the inappropriate diversion of profit shares. The intended purpose of the section is to reallocate profits of a partnership to an individual partner where the requirements of the section are met, and to impose <u>additional</u> requirements not present in the statutory wording and not necessary for its operation is not permissible.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_33"><span class="judgment-body__number">33.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Soares also submitted that the FTT erred at [213] to [216] of the Decision in not exercising its discretion to reduce the reallocation of the profit share in respect of the four months that the Appellant was not a partner in AAM. He submitted that the FTT might have apportioned this on a time basis – reducing the reallocation by 50% because he was a partner for four months and a non-partner for four months.  Alternatively, he suggested that the reallocation should be apportioned according to the proportion of turnover generated by AAM in the period while the Appellant was a partner.  </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_34"><span class="judgment-body__number">34.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We are satisfied that this aspect of Ground 1 is no more than a challenge to the FTT’s findings and a submission that the FTT erred in determining it just and reasonable to increase the Appellant’s profit to the full extent of W Ltd’s profits. This, as it seems to us, is an impermissible attempt to argue primary points of discretion, and absent a contention that the FTT erred as a matter of law, the FTT’s Decision must stand. Having rejected the error of law contended for by the Appellant – namely that the FTT had misconstrued section 850C in the manner we have described – we consider that the Appellant has not articulated, in Ground 1, any further basis for contending that the FTT had erred as a matter of law.</p></div></section></section><section><p><b>E.</b><b>GROUND 2</b></p><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_35"><span class="judgment-body__number">35.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The basis upon which Ground 2 was articulated rested upon the FTT’s “overall conclusion” at [170] to [172] of the Decision that the Appellant’s services to AAM, AF and W Ltd were “fungible”. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_36"><span class="judgment-body__number">36.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is appropriate to set out the relevant paragraphs of the Decision:</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">“170.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Our overall conclusion, based on these findings of fact, is that Mr Walewski's work for W Ltd, AAM and AF was fungible; it is not possible on the basis of any evidence which we saw, to separate his role into discrete components; his work for one was his work for each and all of those entities.

Here, quite clearly, the FTT was holding that the manner in which Mr Walewski provided his services was utterly fluid and essentially unknowable.
