                           was in the area, to follow-up on Mother’s mental health. Mother was reported as complaining
                           she felt unsupported by Father, who was staying up late in the evening and then spending
                           the day in bed. Father was referred to as “heavy handed” with the Child, not bonding
                           with her and calling the Child unpleasant names. Mother said Father was staying up
                           late in the evening and then spending the day in bed. While there, the Health Visitor
                           observed a red mark to the Child’s lower leg as Mother was picking her up from her
                           crib. She later recorded Mother’s explanation that a bottle of milk had fallen on
                           the Child, and that when she asked to see the Child’s other leg Mother declined saying
                           she did not want to disturb the Child. As the Child was being put back in the crib
                           the Health Visitor observed another red mark to the left thigh. She made a referral
                           and a child protection medical took place the same day, at which multiple bruises
                           were identified as follows:

                           the investigation was conducted by a neighbouring force.

                              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In Mother’s interview she spoke about knowing the Child had suffered the 2 injuries
                                 to her legs and not seeking medical assistance. She said Father had woken her at 4
                                 in the morning, stating a bottle had fallen across the Child’s legs and might have
                                 been caused by the dog’s tail. Mother said that she had said to Father she would look
                                 at it in the morning, but then forgot until the health visitor’s visit. Because the
                                 bottle was quite big she questioned whether it could have caused the bruise around
                                 the hip area. Mother spoke about not enjoying the pregnancy, but enjoying being a
                                 mum and it having brought her out of a really dark place. She also spoke about having
                                 postnatal depression, but with no formal diagnosis. She stated the pregnancy was planned,
                                 and Father had proposed marriage when she was 20 weeks pregnant. She accepted she
                                 had discharged herself against advice because she does not like hospitals. She spoke
                                 about Father being a fantastic support with no concerns, other than gripes about leaving
                                 the wet towel on the floor or not putting dirty plates in the dishwasher. She said
                                 they had never raised a voice at one another, apart from the wet towel. She also spoke
                                 about him being a bit heavy-handed at times, but clarified this as the speed he would
                                 go to pick the Child up, and stated she would like to sell his XBox. Mother spoke
                                 about the Child being difficult to feed and aggressive with the feeding bottle. Father
                                 would apparently become frustrated with the Child and refer to her as “a little bugger”,
                                 but Mother said he would never swear at or to either the Child or her. She spoke her
                                 family being complete and being happy. The Child was described as sleeping between
                                 around about midnight until about half 6, and she stated Father had come off nights
                                 and initially doing the nightshifts with the Child, then alternating. She said the
                                 Child slept in their room in a Moses basket. She said she did not know why Father
                                 had taken the Child downstairs, but thought the dog had got a bit excited with daddy
                                 coming downstairs. Mother was shown photos of the bruising and accepting the marks
                                 were visible. She raised the possibility of the mark to the back being a birthmark.
                                 She was asked about the Paternal Aunt saying Father had better not have done anything
                                 to the baby, and said the Paternal Aunt was a very outspoken person and it was probably
                                 coming from Father having been the one watching the Child.

                              <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In Father’s police interview he talked about a water spray bottle being knocked onto
                                 the child, landing on her legs, when the puppy got up on the sofa and his tail hit
                                 the bottle. He had apparently been gaming online and changing her when it occurred.
                                 He talked about the dog maybe brushing the Child’s arm when he jumped up with the
                                 bottle, but said he did not know whether the dog actually touched her because it happened
                                 very fast. He said that when it happened she instantly did what he described as a
                                 silent cry. He said he noticed a mark or marks on her legs and that he told Mother
                                 straightaway when she woke up in the morning (and later confirming this). Father was
                                 clear that he had checked the Child over that night and did not know where the other
                                 bruises were from. He stated he was sure Mother went downstairs and had a look. He
                                 then talked about waking up in the morning when the Health Visitor was there and coming
                                 downstairs to hear her say she would be speaking to her manager. Father talked about
                                 having a temper, but said he did not lose his temper easily. He confirmed it was a
                                 planned pregnancy, after 3 months of being together, and also talked about referring
                                 to the Child as “little bugger”, in an endearing way. He also spoke of Mother’s dislike
                                 of hospitals and accepting she had discharged against medical advice. He accepted
                                 sometimes getting frustrated with the Child, but said Mother and he agreed if either
                                 was getting frustrated the other would take over and given them a break. He had no
                                 concerns about Mother’s parenting at all. When asked about the comment made by the
                                 Paternal Aunt he said “she knows I have a temper but she knows that at the end of
                                 the day I can control it and it would never be taken out on a three week old baby
                                 that’s my flesh and blood and that I love dearly”.

                           J (as he then was) stated<sup>8</sup>: To these matters I would only add that in cases where repeated accounts are given
                           of events surrounding injury and death, the court must think carefully about the significance
                           or otherwise of any reported discrepancies. They may arise for a number of reasons.
                           One possibility is of course that they are lies designed to hide culpability. Another
                           is that they are lies told for other reasons. Further possibilities include faulty
                           recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is
                           not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping
                           or recollection of the person hearing or relaying the account. The possible effects
                           of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should
                           the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others. As memory fades, a desire
                           to iron out wrinkles may not be unnatural – a process that might inelegantly be described

                           be less likelihood of inappropriate reliance on what may transpire to be insufficiently
                           cogent and sometimes frankly incorrect expert evidence even where it is uncontradicted”

                                 an accident. It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which
                                 is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong.
                                 That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or
                                 lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction.
                                 While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction
                                 from say negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold
                                 criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely,

                           to do so<sup>25</sup>. Only if it cannot identify the perpetrator to the civil standard of proof should
                           it go on to ask in respect of those on the list: "Is there a likelihood or real possibility

                           the child from them and there should be long-term benefits for the child in knowing
                           the truth if it can be ascertained. Plainly, the threshold criteria can be established
                           by findings that a child has suffered harm whilst in the care of his parents, or other
                           carers, without the need to establish precisely who caused the injuries. Nevertheless,
                           where possible, and for the consideration of a child’s welfare, it is desirable to
                           identify who has and who has not caused the injuries.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Court has read and heard a considerable amount of evidence.  The fact that it
                     does not mention something in this decision does not mean that it has not fully considered
                     it. It is impossible to set out in this decision everything that has been heard and
                     read.  The decision must be based on proper evidence addressing all the realistic
                     options for the child and containing an analysis of the arguments for and against
                     each option.  There must be an adequately reasoned decision which grapples with those
                     factors and which gives a proper and focussed attention to those factors.<sup>27</sup>  The basic principle is that the parties need to understand why the Court makes the
                     findings and orders it does.

                     the Child’s leg and this is what caused the marks. Mother was stating she had been
                     upstairs at the time and Father came upstairs to tell her what had happened. The parents
                     were asked to take the Child to hospital for a medical. The Child remained at hospital
                     overnight, with Father remaining with her. The following day concerns were raised

                     recorded as stating he had spoken to a doctor about the Child staying with relatives
                     due to Mother needing a break due to her mental health. Father identified they would

                     was because he is a new dad. She also spoke about Father worrying about bonding with
                     the Child and that his family was frequently visiting, which she felt was disrupting

                     the baby back up to her he told her a bottle had dropped on the baby’s leg, knocked
                     over by the dog’s tail. As the baby was fine and not in discomfort she said she would
                     look at it in the morning. When she looked at the Child in the morning she noted a
                     mark on her leg, but did not feel anything further was needed. Dr S recorded Mother
                     having a history of depression and anxiety, and currently having post-natal depression.

                     but with a silent cry. When Father was informed of the other bruises he speculated
                     whether the dog could have trodden on her as this had occurred previously. Father
                     informed Dr S that many of the overnight stays with family members had been due to
                     maternal mental health concerns and Father having to help Mother with “breakdowns”.

                     a possibility the bruise to the thigh may have been caused as explained, but required
                     greater clarity such as how the Child was placed and where and how the bottle fell
                     on her leg, but the same event would not have caused the bruise to the calf which
                     was on the opposite leg on the outer side and there was no explanation for the other
                     bruises. She stated the bruises in a 3 week old child with no explanation were highly
                     suspicious of non-accidental injury and cited the RCPCH Safeguarding companion which

                     on many factors such as the laxity of tissues in the individual… Normal handling of
                     the baby should not cause bruises… Bruising is also a widely reported “sentinel” injury

                     mark at the time of examination and discounted the abdominal mark as caused by the
                     umbilical cord or a nappy. She did not rule out the bruise being caused by a car seat.
                     She said that Father had not mentioned the dog jumping on the Child when she spoke
                     to him. She also confirmed there were no scratches around the bruises consistent with
                     a dog’s paws/claws. She accepted wrongly writing down that the injury was to the right

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Miss C had provided a statement to the police about the night of 27 October 2021.
                     Father and the Child were together in a cubicle, described as like an individual room.
                     As she was going to another patient’s room she said she had heard a cry, peeked in
                     the window to see if everything was OK and saw Father pushing the feed bottle into
                     the Child’s mouth as the Child was screaming, then shouting “F***”. She told the nurse
                     in charge, Miss Glancy, who was walking past. The nurse went to speak to Father, who
                     reported the Child as being aggressive on the bottle. She took the Child from Father,
                     at which point the Child stopped crying, settled to take the bottle then fell asleep
                     before she could take the bottle. Miss Glancy’s statement to the police confirmed
                     she did not witness Father do or say anything untoward to the child.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In oral evidence, Miss C accepted she had been looking through a door and could not
                     see properly. She spoke of the Child’s cry being particularly loud and screechy. She
                     could not really make out what Father had been saying save for the F***, which was
                     quite loud. She agreed it would be described as in frustration.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Father’s first statement maintained the bruise to the thigh was caused by the spray
                     bottle falling on the Child, having been knocked off the worktop by the puppy who
                     jumped up whilst he was changing the Child. While Father had apparently acknowledged
                     the bruises in hospital, he stated Mother had informed him the mark to the lower back
                     could be a birthmark. He also attributed the mark to the abdomen as from the umbilical
                     cord. He categorically denied being verbally abusive towards the Child, stating he
                     had said “what the f*** am I doing wrong” as a question for the Child out of frustration.
                     He also completely denied being heavy-handed with the Child, as well as stating Mother
                     was not suffering from mental health problems previously.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mother’s first statement stated she accepted Father’s explanation of how the injuries
                     had occurred and she believed it to be an accident. She referred to the Health Visitor
                     (wrongly stated as the midwife) deciding she may have post-natal depression and disputed
                     any mental health history. She accepted the Child was cared for by the Paternal Aunt
                     and her boyfriend on 24 October 2021 because Mother felt overwhelmed. On the morning
                     of the incident she said Father woke her around 4am and had told her the dog had jumped
                     up, his tail knocking the spray bottle (misinterpreted as a milk bottle) across the
                     Child’s legs, and it may have been possible the dog had trampled on the Child. She
                     questioned whether the mark to the abdomen was caused by the nappy being too tight
                     or the dog trampling on the Child during the accident.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When the Health Visitor arrived Mother said Father was still in bed asleep, that the
                     Child was in a vest and she had nothing to hide. She stated the reference to Father
                     being heavy-handed related to one incident which was due to a lack of knowledge and
                     he did not harm the Child. She also felt the social worker had misconstrued her comments
                     about Father who “has not verbally abused his daughter with malicious intent but in
                     a loving way…” and had called the Child a “little bugger” but it wasn’t abusive in
                     any way. She referred to her comments to her friends as having a moan because it was
                     mainly her doing the night feeds and she felt fed up and exhausted. She also stated
                     she did feel at the time that Father was not as supportive as he should have been.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Father’s second statement stated he had asked the doctors if there was any need (for
                     Mother and Child) to stay at the hospital and the reply was in the negative, as long
                     as they returned for additional checks. He had asked his sister to look after the
                     Child on 24 October because Mother was upset that she may have post-natal depression.
                     On the night of 26/27 October 2021 he stated the Child had been sleeping in her travel
                     cot, Mother having gone to bed at approximately 11pm. The Child woke around 3:30am
                     and was crying, so he put her on the sofa to change her nappy. He said the dog had
                     jumped up in excitement right over the Child and he realised the spray bottle had
                     fallen onto the Child’s legs. He reported pushing the dog off the sofa, picking up
                     the bottle and placing it back on the side. He said it was possible the dog had trampled
                     the Child. The Child was reported to have been crying and he settled her. At around
                     4am he said he went up to the bedroom and woke Mother up, vaguely explained to Mother
                     what had happened and asked her to check the Child over. Later that day he said he
                     had awoken to a commotion downstairs and he saw the Health (Visitor) storming out
                     of the house and Mother crying. Mother advised him the Health (Visitor) had told her
                     the Child should be taken to hospital and Mother had said she did not feel there was
                     any need. Later that afternoon he stated a police detective had rung Mother and informed
                     her either she could take the Child to hospital or she would be made subject to a
                     Police Protection Order. He repeated that he had given Mother limited information
                     at 4am, when she was half asleep. He also characterised the family members caring
                     for the Child as because they were excited to spend time with and care for her.

                     He explained a bruise is the escape of blood from ruptured blood vessels. To rupture
                     the blood vessels would need an impact, twisting or gripping force. He did not think
                     a nappy or car seat would cause a bruise unless it was extremely tight, in which case
                     the child would cry out from distress and it would be a memorable event. “Memorable
                     event” was a consistent theme when asked about possible alternative causes, being
                     clear he would expect a credible account of the event and aftermath. He spoke about
                     the lack of detail in explanations being put forward by the parents and that without
                     detail he could not apply forensic analysis. He also said Father’s statement the dog
                     may have trampled on the Child was an inadequate account of a memorable event. While
                     he accepted the calf bruising could have been consistent with being caused by the
                     dog, he pointed to the lack of history and said it was unlikely. He was clear he would
                     have expected the parents to take medical advice, even at 4am, if the dog had trampled
                     on the baby and bruising had been caused. Forensically he explained where injuries
                     are inflicted the carer tends to wait to seek advice in the hope there would be improvement,
                     whereas with accidents advice is normally sought immediately.

                     or mechanism. He also stated a clumsy, inexperienced parent’s handling of a child
                     would not be sufficient to cause bruising. Where a bruise was caused, he stated the
                     carer would have known excessive force had been applied.

                     with no figure for a pre-mobile baby. He described the bruise to the torso as 2 parallel
                     lines. He regarded any bruise as significant and highlighted the very large bruises
                     the Child had. He also stated that to not obtain care constituted medical neglect.

                     concerns except the marks to the Child. The Child was in a vest. Once the first bruise
                     had been seen she asked to inspect the Child, but said Mother had declined. She was
                     clear Mother had told her a bottle of milk had fallen on the Child. While Mother had
                     said Father called the Child names, Miss P did not think Mother had detailed the names
                     used. She said the dog was not mentioned by Mother, despite asking about the first
                     mark. The second mark to the legs was only seen when the Child was put back down in
                     her crib. Miss P had informed Mother she was going to call Children’s Services, and
                     said she was surprised when Mother gave no response.

                     purpose of the visit was to support Mother and when she arrived Mother had launched
                     into a long complaint about Father. She confirmed she had not met Father and had been
                     told, on both visits, that he was upstairs sleeping. At her first visit, on 12 October,
                     she had no recollection of Mother mentioning any injury to the Child’s ear. On the
                     second visit, she said Mother had told her that Father had been up till 4am playing

                     a family meeting on 3 January 2022, which lasted for around a couple of hours. The
                     Paternal Aunt had reportedly expressed upset that the parents had got pregnant so
                     quickly, had a dog and got together so quickly. When asked about hearing Father had
                     called the Child an attention seeking whore she sought to answer an earlier question.
                     When asked again she said she had been extremely shocked and ashamed it had come out
                     of her son’s mouth. However, she also said she had not heard Father say it. She accepted
                     it had stuck in her memory for a while and she knew Father calling the Child names
                     was a concern, but said she had not remembered he called the Child that when asked
                     about names the previous week. She later said she had not said about it because she
                     had not heard him say it, she had just been told he said it. She did not regard the
                     family meeting as unusual and had not felt a need to mention it before. She accepted
                     calling the Child an attention seeking whore had probably not been mentioned in witness
                     statements or oral evidence because they thought it would be quite damning for Father.
                     She accepted withholding the information, but denied an agreement within the family
                     to do so. She agreed withholding that particular name was coincidental. She categorised
                     it as a flippant remark, then said it was not directed at the Child.

                     when Father admitted calling the Child an attention seeking whore. She continued to
                     refer to parts of the proceedings as a bit pathetic. She spoke about there being an
                     agenda from the beginning and a vendetta. When it was pointed out that the proceedings
                     had discovered how Father spoke of the Child, that Father had regularly been abusive
                     to Mother, that Father has a temper and throws things at the wall and the parents’
                     relationship was unhealthy, she called the Guardian’s advocate patronising and rude.
                     She described Father’s admissions to the family making a decision to withhold information
                     as trying to protect Mother. However, by the end of her evidence she accepted there
                     was a risk for the Child to go back into the home environment.

                     Child. He accepted hearing how Father was in the relationship with Mother, but said
                     there must have been some back and forth. While he was slightly shocked by the revelations

                     it is hard to un-tell or own up to. Lies may be told on the spur of the moment in
                     a flush of panic without much forethought, but owning up to a lie requires a cold,
                     calculated decision. Owning up to the lie may be against a person’s own interests.
                     However, it can be psychologically beneficial. Once you have told a lie about someone

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The parents were placed under the spotlight and asked to explain the injuries. It
                     would be natural for them to consider possible explanations and put those forward.
                     To do so, in itself, does not amount to something they should be criticised for. What
                     explanations put forward need to be considered against the evidence. The echo chamber
                     of the Intervenors adds nothing to the analysis of the evidence. However, the vehemence
                     with which they sought to defend the parents and criticise the authorities displayed
                     a confirmation bias – they had made up their minds and then sought to promote a case
                     which fitted this – which completely ignored what they knew about the situation in
                     the family home.

                     could have been demonstrated and confused for the Child crying generally. However,
                     there is no great body of research about injuries being caused to babies for the simple
                     reason they would be re-designed if there were.

                     Dr R was clear any incident where the child was injured would have been significant.
                     Father postulated it could have been the dog and all the other parties took up the
                     cry. Mother gave evidence about the training the dog had received. The parents produced
                     photos of the dog showing it sitting on the long end of the sofa on a blanket. He
