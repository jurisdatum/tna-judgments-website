                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">These proceedings concern claims for breach of confidence, misuse of private information
                     and data protection legislation in an unusual context. At a high level, the context
                     may be described as follows. The complaint is of alleged improper threats made by
                     a commercial counterparty (the Defendant) to disclose the content of private conversations
                     between representatives of the other side to negotiations (the Claimants) which were
                     overheard by the Defendant (from another room) in the course of a business acquisition
                     meeting.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Following a without notice hearing, Stacey J granted an interim non-disclosure order
                     restraining disclosure of such private conversation (and any recordings of them) on
                     1 April 2022 (“the INDO”).  This is my judgment on the return day. The Claimants seek
                     continuation of the INDO. The Defendant opposes that and argues that the INDO should
                     never have been granted.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Unfortunately, a transcript of the without notice hearing before Stacey J was not
                     available at the hearing before me but I did have the Claimants’ solicitor’s note
                     of the hearing, which is reasonably detailed but does not always clearly distinguish
                     between Counsel’s submission and what was said by the Judge. The INDO was continued
                     by a consent order made by Nicklin J on 11 April 2022, pending the contested hearing
                     before me on 12 May 2022.  Pursuant to Nicklin J’s further directions, the parties
                     have served pleadings (in addition to a number of additional witness statements).
                     As often happens, the discipline of having to plead their cases has caused the parties
                     to focus more clearly on their detailed legal and factual positions.

                     to court documents. With the agreement of the parties, I discharged that order at
                     the start of the hearing given that it was no longer justifiable or necessary.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For reasons set out below, I have decided to continue the injunction until trial or
                     further order but on modified terms which differ from the terms sought by the Claimants
                     in the draft order presented to me. I have concerns about the lack of clarity in the
                     language of the restraints and that is related to the rather odd factual position
                     in this case, where the Claimants cannot with precision identify the confidential
                     information in issue. I referred to these concerns at the start of the hearing and
                     invited submissions as to the potential modification to the scope of the injunction.
                     Counsel for the Claimants accepted my suggestion as to how the injunction might be
                     modified but Counsel for the Defendant, as he was entitled to do, maintained a root
                     and branch opposition to any form of relief. The Defendant also declined to give any
                     form of undertaking (despite having agreed in correspondence not to disclose anything
                     to any third party).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I will begin with an outline of the facts. This case is at an early stage and a range
                     of important factual issues are in dispute. Nothing I say represents any form of concluded
                     finding but I will need to form a view as to the merits of the claims given that the
                     enhanced test in relation to an INDO has to be applied. Section 12(3) of the Human
                     Rights Act 1998 is engaged and the Claimants need to show more than merely the standard
                     “serious issue to be tried” and need to satisfy me they are “more likely than not”
                     to succeed: <u>Cream Holdings v Banerjee</u> [2005] 1 AC 252 at [22].

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As appears below, there is a substantial underlying commercial dispute between the
                     parties which is not of direct relevance but I will need to refer to it to provide
                     context. I should record that Counsel for the Defendant forcefully submitted that
                     the current injunction proceedings are in effect no more than a tactical step and
                     oppressive act in that overall dispute. I cannot form any view as to that matter.
                     I can only proceed on the basis of the evidence and arguments before me in relation
                     to the INDO.

                     in Loughton on 13 August 2020. The major issue was the price of the Target within
                     the context of a proposed transaction on the basis of a multiple of EBITDA. Within
                     the Loughton offices there is a standard CCTV system that makes audio-visual recordings
                     of events in those offices. There is a conflict of evidence as to how conspicuous
                     that system was and what GG and JR knew (or should have appreciated) about such recording.
                     The photographic evidence before me shows that entrants to the building are given
                     a notice of CCTV recording, as is now commonplace (a sign says “CCTV in operation”).

                     in that room was “covert” cannot be correct.

                     room. It is not clear for how long D was away. It may have been for a very short while
                     because there is some evidence he was going to his office (right next door to the
                     meeting room) just to collect some papers.

                     some 20 months ago. In their pleaded case, supported by the witness statements, their
                     private conversation is said to be on the following 4 broad topics (I will call these

                     clearly hear” what they were saying through the wall of his adjoining room. What he
                     says he heard them say is in the confidential annexe.  This is text I have taken from
                     the Defence (para. 8) and I will refer to the first matter in the annexe as “Item
                     A” and the second as “Item B”. While there is some overlap between these items and
                     the four areas that the Claimants say were the subject of private conversations between
                     GG and JR, Items A and B are much more limited. D argues that these matters are not
                     confidential. For their part, the Claimants deny Items A and B were comments made
                     by either GG or JR.

                     intended to be heard by him and “which the Second and Third Defendants were not tactful
                     enough to say quietly”. He says that “with due regard to whether I may simply have
                     been too sensitive I found what I heard rather disturbing”. On his own evidence, D’s
                     actions when he heard these matters were somewhat strange. He said that on an “impulse
                     which I cannot logically explain, probably because it was all I could do, I pressed
                     the screenshot button on the visual recording system”. That screenshot is in evidence
                     before me (and appears below when I set out the alleged threat).  His evidence is
                     that there was no recorded soundtrack of what GG and JR were saying, although “…what
                     the Second and Third Defendants had said was said loud enough for me with unaided
                     hearing to hear through the partition wall”.  He adds that he was “frankly embarrassed
                     to have heard” what was said but said nothing to GG and JR because part of the intended
                     share purchase agreement was that he work with the Claimants after the purchase, and
                     he wanted relations to be good.

                     CC and D concerning performance of the SPA. Negotiations to settle that dispute took
                     place in early 2022 and the dispute was the subject of a letter of claim from the
                     First Claimant to D dated 3 March 2022. There are, putting matters neutrally, substantial
                     financial disputes and intellectual property ownership disputes between the parties.
                     In these proceedings, D has made a Counterclaim, as I outline below, in respect of

                     of evidence as to what took place on that day. GG says that there was an in-person
                     meeting at the First Claimant’s offices in East Cheap, London. GG’s evidence is that
                     at that meeting D made an improved offer; and that he (GG) phoned D to accept that
                     offer in principle that same evening, but that the agreement later broke down over
                     the details.

                     to the telephone conversation between himself and GG.  D states that in the course
                     of that conversation GG was aggressive at first but tried to sweeten the conversation
                     by suggesting a meeting over a glass of wine; by this time “it was clear that relations
                     had broken down”. D says he recalled what GG and JR had said on 13 August 2020 and
                     that he reminded GG of this. D adds that GG denied that he and JR had even been alone
                     in a meeting room at the Target’s offices on 13 August 2020; and “by way of showing
                     that his denial was factually untrue”, D thought to use the screenshot.

                     below the screenshot stating, “You should know this doesn’t do you any favours. Whilst

                     indicated to them that D had covertly filmed and recorded GG and JR talking privately
                     in that meeting room, whilst he was out of the room and that he regarded what they
                     said as showing them in a bad light. They say D’s texts threaten to release the recording
                     onto social media to embarrass JR and GG (and it is to be noted, they say, that D
                     did not deny in his texts that he was making a threat). They argue that the commercial
                     context of the threat strongly implied that D would carry out this threat unless the
                     Claimants offered a resolution to the commercial dispute that was more favourable
                     to him than what was currently on offer.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">D contests this. He links the communication with the 3 March 2022 call with GG where
                     he referred to a photo and says “…subsequently I did find the photo and sent the Second
                     Claimant a copy of the screen shot”, together with the message I have set out above
                     in paragraph 21.  His evidence is that did not mean that he intended to put the photo
                     on any social or other media, but this was instead a reference to GG’s proposal of
                     a social meeting, which in the context of their awkward and difficult relationship,
                     would have been either pointless, or a total charade, or possibly have made matters
                     even worse. In short, D says this was not an attempt at blackmail. It was a response
                     to hypocrisy. It was also emphasised on D’s behalf that the screenshot image has not
                     been sent to any third party.

                     He stated that “for clarity and peace of mind, I respect our confidentiality and that
                     will never break, and I can confirm that it’s the only picture I have, there is no
                     video or audio recording”. He apologised to GG.  This attitude is somewhat different
                     to the more combative approach taken in his evidence.

                     to plead their Particulars of Claim taking into account D’s position, as would be
                     usual in a claim following pre-action correspondence. They included asking D how he
                     came to have a screenshot of the meeting and whether he recorded the meeting on 13
                     August 2022 or listened to the private discussions between GG and JR at the meeting;

                     been provided by D). By the date of the hearing before me, there was no issue in this

                     was referred to the helpful summary in <i>Toulson &amp; Phipps on Confidentiality </i>(4th Ed.) at para. 2-002. In short, the Claimants need to establish that the content
                     of the oral discussions between GG and JR had the necessary quality of confidence,
                     that D came to know of what was being said in circumstances importing an obligation
                     of confidence, and that there has been unauthorized use or a threat to use that information.

                     whether information has been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of
                     confidence, I must approach that question objectively and by reference to a reasonable
                     person standing in the position of the recipient. As explained in <i>The Law of Privacy and the Media</i> at para 4.20, “imparting” in the context of the second element of the tort should
                     not be read restrictively, so that a duty can arise even if the communication of the
                     information was made “accidentally, or merely from acquisition”. A duty of confidence
                     arises when confidential information comes to the knowledge of a person in circumstances
                     where he has notice, or is held to have agreed, that the information is confidential,
                     with the effect that it would be just in all the circumstances that he should be precluded
                     from disclosing the information to others.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although GG and JR cannot now recall the precise details of what they discussed between
                     themselves (beyond the subject-matter - the four areas), in my judgment a reasonable
                     person in D’s shoes would appreciate that a conversation held behind closed doors,
                     between individuals on the opposite side to him in a business negotiation on these
                     subjects, was both private and confidential.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Further, I am satisfied that the subject-matter (the four areas) of these conversations
                     was such as to attract confidentiality. I note that D does not deny that he heard
                     them discussing business matters; indeed he pleads in paragraph 8 of the Defence that
                     they did so. Upon the evidence, I cannot conclude that GG and JR were simply making
                     “<i>casual comments</i>”, if that means comments of a trivial or anodyne nature such as are not worthy of
                     protection.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I consider that the Claimants have sufficiently defined the confidential information
                     in their pleading (even if the terms of the injunction they seek are not appropriate:
                     see my discussion below). I am satisfied they are likely to succeed at trial in showing
                     that the four areas were discussed by them and D heard what they said.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I note that D alleges in his Defence that he “did not listen to what was being said
                     until he heard remarks disparaging of himself”. I find that difficult to follow: if
                     D was not listening he would not have heard what was said about him. Furthermore,
                     it is apparent from D’s own case that whilst GG and JR were alone in the meeting room
                     D must have gone to a computer screen showing a livestream of the CCTV and deliberately
                     viewed them. Unless he was viewing a screen showing the two of them, he could not
                     have made the “screenshot”. I consider it likely he was watching them on screen at
                     the same time as listening to them through the wall; as he states in his first witness
                     statement, he “could clearly hear what the Second and Third Claimants were saying”,
                     although he denies using the audio function of the CCTV livestream to listen to them
                     electronically.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Whether or not D was actively eavesdropping, the duty of confidence does not arise
                     only when a person actively seeks out private and confidential information. A duty
                     of confidence may arise when a person has notice that the information they receive
                     is of a confidential nature, and D knew that GG and JR were having a private discussion.
                     In the context of the commercial negotiations taking place on 13 August 2020, it would
                     in my judgment be obvious to D that what was being discussed between GG and JR (when
                     he had left) was private and confidential insofar as it extended to aspects of the
                     proposed transaction and commercial intentions and future plans for the Target.

                     likely to be detrimental to them and to the First Claimant. This is so whether or
                     not the information is relayed accurately or truthfully. I cannot see any public interest
                     in the disclosure of information as to GG’s and JR’s private discussions. There is,
                     however, an important public interest in protecting the confidentiality of private
                     and commercially sensitive conversations.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, the nature of the threat of disclosure has not changed since the hearing
                     before Stacey J, at which the judge accepted that the text messages sent by D were
                     reasonably to be understood as making a threat. The threat remains real. D has refused
                     to give an undertaking in relation to information about the contents of GG/JR’s private
                     discussions, even in the modified form I suggested at the hearing. I cannot at an
                     interim stage decide whether the threat of disclosure was to be via social media (that
                     is certainly an available reading) but that does not seem to me to matter given that
                     I consider any reading indicates a threatened disclosure to third parties.

                     their conversation, behind closed doors, as giving rise to a reasonable expectation
                     of privacy.  At the second stage of the inquiry, the disclosure of the private information
                     on the four areas does not make any contribution to a debate of general interest,
                     nor is there any other realistic justification for it. The claim in misuse of private
                     information is more likely than not to succeed at trial.  Further, although I need
                     to weigh the freedom of expression rights of D against these privacy rights, D’s rights
                     in these circumstances are limited.

                     that as drafted this restraint was too vague. It is a cardinal rule that a defendant
                     should know with certainty what he is and is not allowed to do. I do not consider
                     the term “private conversations” without any further and more precise identification
                     of subject-matter to be sufficiently certain. It suffers from being both too broad
                     (apt to cover something like a discussion of the weather - which is not worthy of
                     protection) but also too vague for the court to police.

                     (“<i>an impulse which I cannot logically explain</i>”), he took a souvenir of that surveillance by way of a screenshot of a CCTV livestream.
                     He then kept this souvenir on his mobile phone for a period of some 19 months and
                     sought to use the screenshot as some form pressure point in negotiations over performance
                     of the SPA, by sending a text that, on an objective construction, threatened the use/release
                     of GG and JR’s private conversation. I consider that on the evidence before me the
                     screenshot was used to add credence to the claim that he knew the content of the private
