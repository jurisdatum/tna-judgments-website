                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This is the damages inquiry following the decision of David Stone (sitting as a Deputy
                     High Court Judge) dated 5<sup>th</sup> March 2020 (<i>Geofabrics Ltd v Fiberweb Geosynthetics Ltd </i>[2020] EWHC 444 (Pat)) in which he found the Defendant liable for infringement of
                     European Patent (UK) EP 2 430 238. The Defendant appealed that finding, but Mr Stone’s
                     decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 11 June 2021 (<i>Geofabrics Ltd v Fiberweb Geosynthetics Ltd </i>[2021] EWCA Civ 854).

                     was represented by Dr Geoffrey Pritchard, Mr Charles Brabin and Ms Alice Hart. Dr
                     Pritchard undertook the bulk of the oral advocacy for the Defendant, but each of Mr
                     Brabin and Ms Hart addressed me on a discrete point of argument in closing. Parties
                     are encouraged to look for opportunities to enable junior counsel to undertake oral
                     advocacy in this way.  I am grateful to counsel on both sides for their helpful submissions.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The technical background to the patent is conveniently summarised in Mr Stone’s judgment
                     at [5]-[11], to which the reader is referred. In summary, the patent concerns a geosynthetic
                     trackbed liner (also sometimes called an anti-pumping geocomposite) that sits as a
                     geotextile layer between the soil (or subgrade) and the ballast underneath railway
                     tracks. It is used to ameliorate a problem known as “pumping erosion” that is seen
                     with clay subgrades. This is a well-known problem caused by water, clay and silt leaching
                     out of the subgrade by the weight of the train as it travels over the track. Over
                     time, removal of clay and silt causes erosion to the trackbed and settling of the
                     track, which requires remediation. 
                  </p>
               </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_4"><span class="judgment-body__number">4.</span><div>
                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The problem of pumping erosion had previously been addressed by using a layer of sand
                     (a “sand blanket”) between the subgrade and the ballast, but this was expensive and
                     inconvenient to lay. In 2010 the Claimant launched its geocomposite product, Tracktex,
                     as an alternative to a sand blanket (although sand remains approved for use as geocomposites
                     are not suitable for all rail lines). A geocomposite has several advantages over a
                     sand blanket which are said to make it commercially and environmentally attractive,
                     including lower materials costs and lower costs of installation, and less track downtime
                     required to install it.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant launched its rival product, Hydrotex 2, in July 2012. Hydrotex 2 was
                     found to infringe the patent. It was on the market until June 2021, when the Court
                     of Appeal dismissed the Defendant’s appeal and the stay of the injunction ordered
                     by Mr Stone pending appeal came to an end. In May 2021, the Defendant introduced a
                     replacement for Hydrotex 2 called Hydrotex 4. All sales of Hydrotex 4 are deemed licensed
                     and so are not relevant to this judgment. At all material times Tracktex and Hydrotex
                     2 were the only commercially available alternatives to a sand blanket.

                     no claim based on a reasonable royalty in respect of any infringing sales that the
                     Claimant would not have made itself.

                     times he was (and remains) the Claimant’s Managing Director. He has been involved
                     with Tracktex since he joined the Claimant in October 2009 and was responsible for
                     Tracktex sales from when it was first approved. He provided six written statements
                     and gave oral testimony. I found Mr Donald to be a careful witness. He gave clear
                     and direct answers to questions and was able to speak first-hand about events that
                     happened during the relevant period to the best of his recollection.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant did not criticise the way in which Mr Donald gave evidence but submitted
                     that his views of what would have happened in the counterfactual should be scrutinised
                     carefully for the reasons explained by Norris J in <i>Servier v Apotex Inc </i>[2008] EWHC 2347 at [11]. As Norris J said in <i>Servier</i>, even the most honest witness can innocently give self-serving evidence about what
                     they would have intended or done in the counterfactual, with the result that this
                     evidence must be assessed carefully by reference to whatever objective tools and evidence
                     are to hand. However, in the same passage the judge warned that this assessment is
                     not an opportunity for the court to construct its own hypothetical world out of the
                     available materials in place of that argued by the parties.  I have the whole of that
                     passage well in mind in my assessment of all the evidence (not just that of Mr Donald).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the Defendant, factual evidence was provided by Mr Stephen Hancock. He provided
                     three written statements and also gave oral evidence. Mr Hancock has worked for the
                     Defendant (or its predecessors) since 1988 but did not get involved with rail sales
                     until around 2007. He was promoted to Sales Director in November 2012, responsible
                     for managing the Network Rail account. His title changed to Key Account Manager in
                     2014, but he remained responsible for the Network Rail account until 2015 when his
                     role changed. He then had little involvement with UK rail sales until 2018. His evidence
                     was that he did not have hands on involvement during this period, although he continued
                     to have some awareness of matters relating to sales of Hydrotex and the operation
                     of the 2014 tender (of which more below).

                     the Claimant fairly observed that he did not know certain key facts and submitted
                     that, as a result, some of his evidence should be treated with caution. This submission
                     is best addressed in the context of the issues in which it arises (see below).

                     going first. Both experts also gave careful oral testimony and were clearly doing
                     their best to assist the court in respect of matters within their expertise.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant criticised Mr Chapman because there were some errors in the calculations
                     in his first report and he did not provide a coherent reason for the changes in approach
                     he made to the calculations in his second report. Whilst there is some basis for this
                     criticism, I bear in mind that Mr Chapman corrected the errors in his second report.
                     I also bear in mind that there is more than one way to approach the assessment of
                     damages in this case. That is something that both experts accepted. The Defendant
                     also submitted that Mr Chapman’s approach to various issues was at best internally
                     inconsistent and at worst selective in favour of his client.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As a result of these points, the Defendant argued that I should prefer the evidence
                     of Mr MacGregor. I do not consider this to be a case where it is helpful or appropriate
                     generally to “prefer” the evidence of one expert over another in the way that can
                     sometimes be seen in respect of technical expert evidence in patent cases. Instead,
                     I must approach each issue in turn, doing my best to determine what would have happened
                     in the counterfactual by reference to the available evidence with respect to that
                     issue.  That includes the evidence of what actually happened, the evidence of Mr Donald
                     about what the Claimant’s intentions would have been (subject to the warnings given
                     by Norris J in <i>Servier v Apotex</i> that I have referred to above), and the evidence of the experts (including, importantly,
                     the reasons they give for their opinions).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is convenient at this stage to note that both experts built detailed financial
                     models which they used to calculate the overall damages figure based on their opinions
                     of the suggested input parameters.  However, the parties agreed that it was not necessary
                     for me to learn how to operate the models or to reach a determination of the final
                     damages sum as part of this judgment. Instead, the parties will work with their experts
                     to input the necessary parameters that arise from my decision into the models and
                     agree the resulting figure. It may be necessary for me to give directions about this,
                     and I will hear from counsel as to the appropriate way forward in due course. However,
                     since the experts agreed on the methodology for doing the calculations, this should
                     be a reasonably straightforward exercise and I am confident that the parties will
                     co-operate effectively.  The only downside with this approach, at least from my perspective,
                     is that I have not been able to sense check the consequences of my judgment in terms
                     of the overall damages figure. This has felt rather uncomfortable but is the necessary
                     consequence of the way in which the evidence was prepared and presented.

                     called Aqua Fabrications Ltd (“Aqua”).  The evidence of Mr Donald was that the Claimant
                     used Aqua because it had good sales and marketing infrastructure and a good track

                     no evidence from Aqua and Mr Donald did not actually know the prices that Aqua sold

                     unchallenged evidence was that this was based on a price of £12.74/m<sup>2</sup>, although the Claimant’s skeleton also refers me to the tender agreement and that
                     includes a range of prices based on the width of the roll and whether it was delivered
                     or provided ex works. In fact, the £12.74/m<sup>2</sup> price was the lowest price in the range (for a 3.9m roll, ex works) and £15.64/m<sup>2 </sup>was the highest (for a 3m roll, delivered). It was not clear if the Claimant ever
                     made any sales under the Unipart tender framework agreement, but nothing turns on

                     Hydrotex 2 instead of Tracktex and to maintain good relations with Aqua. As a result,
                     on 6 December 2013 the Claimant entered into an exclusive distribution agreement with
                     Aqua and did not bid for the Second Tender.

                     important to record some of the points which fell away. The Claimant had helpfully
                     provided a list of issues with its opening skeleton which was significantly longer
                     (with 14 main issues, several of which had multiple sub issues).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Of the original list, the most significant point to fall away was the need to consider
                     different counterfactuals. The Claimant’s case had been pleaded by reference to two
                     alternative counterfactuals (Counterfactual A and Counterfactual B). The difference
                     between them was that Counterfactual A was based on a situation where there was a
                     Network Rail tender process in 2013 whereas Counterfactual B was based on a situation
                     where there was no Network Rail tender process. The experts had considered these different
                     counterfactual scenarios in their reports (although for reasons which are not clear
                     Mr MacGregor termed them ‘But For Scenario A’ and ‘But For Scenario B’). Mr MacGregor
                     also considered an additional counterfactual which he called ‘But For Scenario C’;
                     this was also based on an assumed Network Rail tender process but differed in other
                     details from But For Scenario A. The parties opening written arguments also addressed
                     these different counterfactuals.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, in oral opening the parties agreed that in the counterfactual, Network Rail
                     would not have entered into a tender process and that the inquiry could proceed on
                     the basis of Counterfactual B/But For Scenario B alone. As a result, I do not have
                     to address Counterfactual A or But For Scenarios A and C any further.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Since it was only as part of Counterfactual A that the Claimant was pursuing a claim
                     in respect of convoyed goods, this point also fell away (as already noted above) and
                     I have not addressed any of the evidence that related to the parties’ other products.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Within his But For Scenario B, Mr MacGregor considered three different scenarios which
                     he referred to as “the primary calculation”, “the alternative calculation” and “the
                     instructed calculation”. The alternative calculation was based on a situation where
                     there was 0% price growth, but a modified price adjustment mechanism based on quantities
                     purchased. This scenario was also not pursued. The difference between the primary
                     calculation and the instructed calculation relates to whether Network Rail sales in
                     the counterfactual were made directly by the Claimant or via Aqua. This is addressed
                     under Issue 1.

                              re-write history. “What if Lectra had not been there for a period of 5 years?” is
                              my task. When I first looked at the accountants' various reports, supplementary reports,
                              and further supplementary reports, I thought they were counting the uncountable; assuming

                              present (of a patentee manufacturer) is a much harder, and less certain, task than
                              I had hitherto thought. Although I have had to reach an answer I do not pretend it
                              is an accurate measure of the damage, of what would have been. It is just the best
                              assessment I can make. Moreover a number of aspects of the claim show that damage
                              can potentially be large even if an infringer's sales are comparatively low. I have
                              in mind particularly the effect of price depression on the patentee's sales, lost
                              profits when lost sales affect marginal profits, and the loss of sales of articles
                              or services associated with the patented goods. and of course all these heads have
                              their own uncertainties of quantification.</span></p>

                     be resolved by making assumptions generous to the claimant. Both parties referred
                     me to the passage in <i>Gary Fearns v Anglo-Dutch Paint &amp; Chemical Co Ltd </i>[2010] EWHC 1708 (Ch) at [70] where Mr Leggatt QC (as he then was) said:

                              necessary to consider what would have happened if the Defendants had acted lawfully
                              and had not induced the franchisees to transfer their business to Anglo Dutch in June
                              2005. This necessarily involves a large element of conjecture. The need for such conjecture,
                              however, is itself a consequence of the Defendants’ conduct. It seems to me that,
                              as in cases where the Court has to form a view of what would have happened in hypothetical
                              circumstances in order to evaluate a lost chance, the principle in <i>Armory v Delamirie</i><b><i> </i></b>(1722) 1 Stra 505 applies. In essence, this requires the Court to resolve uncertainties
                              by making assumptions generous to the claimant where it is the defendant’s wrongdoing
                              which has created those uncertainties: see e.g. <i>Browning v Brachers</i><b><i> </i></b>[2005] EWCA Civ 753, [2005] PNLR 44 at paras 204-212; <i>Phillips &amp; Co v Whatley</i><b><i> </i></b>[2008] Lloyd’s IR 111, 121 at para 45. This also accords with the second of the two

                     power of one party to provide evidence in support of a particular point.  See Lord
                     Bingham in <i>Fairchild v Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd &amp; Ors </i>[2002] UKHL 22 at [13] where he approved the principle stated by Lord Mansfield in
                     <i>Blatch v Archer </i>(1775) 1 Cowp 63 at 65 to the effect that evidence must be weighed against the proof
                     which it was in the power of one side to produce and the other side to contradict.
                     See also <i>McGregor on Damages</i> (21<sup>st</sup> Edition) at §52-021 which addresses the specific situation where a party has lost
                     or destroyed information which could have assisted the court in determining the level
                     of damages. In that situation, the court may draw adverse inferences against that
                     party, but should not do so in a way that is punitive. Any adverse inference should
                     take account of the evidence that does exist and should be realistic.

                     established in the market and does not grant licences, the court should assume that
                     sales made by an infringer (particularly one that is a newcomer to the market) would
                     have been sales made by the patentee unless the infringer proves to the contrary.
                     The case concerned a patent for a process rather than a product. One of the heads
                     of damage related to the loss of contracts for the sale of machinery that operated

                                    the customers with its own non-infringing lintels, or (b) such customers would have

                              is a distinction is in principle clear; what is not always clear is where the line

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="background-color:initial">Sometimes what the claimant has lost was only ever an opportunity to obtain something
                              else, for example the chance to take part in a competition or the opportunity to bring
                              litigation. Such an opportunity is a valuable right in itself, and what the claimant
                              proves (on the balance of probabilities) is that he has lost that right; the assessment
                              of the value of the right then depends on the chances of success. As Patten LJ says
                              in <i>Vasiliou</i> at [21] this is because what has been lost is by definition the loss of a chance.
                              It would obviously be wrong to value the right to take part in a competition at the
                              value of the prize that might be won as the claimant never had a right to the prize,
                              only the right to enter the competition. It would also be wrong to value the right
                              to bring litigation as if it were bound to succeed, if, as is almost inevitably the
                              case, the outcome of the litigation is uncertain. A claim with a prospect of success
                              has a value, but until judgment has been obtained (and indeed it is clear that it
                              can be successfully enforced) that value is not the same as the amount which would
                              be awarded were it to succeed.</span></p>

                              is not quite the same type of case as <i>Allied Maples</i>. In an <i>Allied Maples</i> case the claimant has not lost a valuable right, but he has lost the opportunity
                              of gaining a benefit, albeit one which depends on a third party acting in a particular
                              way. In such a case the claimant is not required to prove that the third party would
                              have acted in that way, only that there was a real and substantial chance that he
                              would. This is still a question of causation, not of quantification (see <i>Vasiliou</i> at [22], and also <i>First Interstate Bank of California v Cohen Arnold &amp; Co</i> [1996] CLC 174 at 182 per Ward LJ, cited in <i>Vasiliou</i> at [43]); but if the claimant does establish that there was such a real and substantial
                              chance, then when it come<i>[s]</i> to quantification, his damages will be assessed not at 100% of the value of the benefit
                              he would have obtained, but at the appropriate percentage having regard to the chances
                              of his obtaining it. I only add the obvious point that in some cases, where the chance
                              is found to be say 30%, the requirement that the claimant only need show that he has
                              lost a real and substantial chance is beneficial to him (as if he had to prove how
                              the third party would have acted on the balance of probabilities, he would recover
                              nothing); but in other cases, where the chance is assessed at say 70%, it has the
                              effect of only enabling him to recover 70% of the damages he otherwise would. But
                              as I read the authorities, the claimant does not have a choice whether to adopt the
                              Allied Maples approach; if the case is an Allied Maples type of case, this is the
                              appropriate way to approach the issues of causation and quantification.</span></p>

                              which is dependent on the actions of a third party; rather, he claims he has lost
                              the opportunity to trade generally, and claims the loss of profits that he would have

                              have traded successfully. It is not entirely clear if this is part of the question
                              of causation and a separate exercise from quantification; or whether it is to be regarded
                              as part of the quantification exercise. Toulson LJ in <i>Parabola</i> at [23] fairly clearly treats the finding of Flaux J that “on a balance of probability
                              Tangent would have traded profitably…” as part of the question of causation as he
                              deals with it in the context of the claimant having first to establish an actionable
                              head of loss, and coming before the “next task” which is “to quantify the loss”. On
                              the other hand Patten LJ in <i>Vasiliou</i> at [23] seems to have regarded the question as part of the exercise of quantification:
                              see his reference to there being “no doubt at all that the breach had caused the loss
                              subject only to the quantification of that loss”, and to Mr Vasiliou’s competence
                              and the restaurant’s prospects of success not being matters that went to causation
                              at all but being relevant at most to the assessment of how profitable the restaurant
                              would have been.</span></p>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="background-color:initial">On either view this is clearly a different type of exercise from that undertaken in
                              an <i>Allied Maples</i> case. It does not require the Court to find that there was a real and substantial
                              chance of a third party acting in a particular way; but to reach a conclusion whether
                              trading would have been profitable or not. However the exercise is characterised,
                              I think it must follow that this is a simple yes/no question (would the trading have
                              been profitable?), and hence falls to be decided on the balance of probabilities.
                              I accept that this is so, even though as a matter of strict logic it is not entirely
                              obvious why there should be such a sharp difference of approach from the <i>Allied Maples</i> type of case. The profitability of the restaurant in Vasiliou presumably depended
                              on whether it would have attracted sufficient custom, or in other words whether a
                              number of third parties would have chosen to come to Mr Vasiliou’s restaurant; and
                              this does not seem very different in kind, only in degree, from the question in <i>Allied Maples</i> which was whether the third party in question would have chosen to accede to Allied
                              Maples’ request for a particular contractual term. It may be that the difference is
                              between one particular third party and a pool of potential customers; in the case
                              of an individual third party, the Court must assess the chance of his acting in a
                              particular way, but in the case of a pool of potential customers, the Court is not
                              concerned with how any individual would have behaved but with whether there would
                              have been sufficient custom generally to make the business a success.</span></p>

                              best attempt it can to quantify the loss of profits taking into account all the various
                              contingencies which affect this: see <i>Parabola</i> at [23]. This neither requires any particular matter to be proved on the balance
                              of probabilities (see Parabola at [24]) nor has anything to do with the loss of a
                              chance as such (see <i>Vasiliou</i> at [25]). The assessment of the loss will itself include an evaluation of all the
                              chances, great or small, involved in the trading (see Parabola at [23]). Once the
                              judge has assessed the profits in this way, any further discount is therefore inappropriate

                              that are proportionate to the chances – one might call these ‘damages for loss of

                              damages are inappropriate where the uncertainty is as to what the <i>claimant </i>(in contrast to a third party) would have hypothetically done. The correct picture
                              of the law on proof in relation to damages is therefore that where the uncertainty
                              is as to past fact, the ‘all or nothing balance of probabilities’ test applies. Where
                              the uncertainty is as to the future, proportionate damages are appropriate. Where
                              the uncertainty is as to hypothetical events, the correct test to be applied depends
                              on the nature of the uncertainty: if it is uncertainty as to what the claimant would
                              have done, the all or nothing balance of probabilities test applies; if it is as to
                              what a third party would have done, damages are assessed proportionately according

                              events, see Mallett v McMonagle [1970] AC 166 at 176 (per Lord Dilock). That there
                              is a contrast between the test applicable to what hypothetically the claimant would

                     predecessor, Terram, had previously developed a product called Terram PW Geosand (Geosand)
                     that was intended as an alternative to a sand blanket. Geosand comprised a thin layer
                     of sand encased between two layers of bonded geotextile. It was approved by Network
                     Rail sometime in about mid 2000 but was deemed to be too expensive and heavy to install
                     and so was not a commercial success. It had a cost of about £28/m<sup>2</sup>, as compared with a sand blanket that had a cost of about £25/m<sup>2</sup>. Geosand was withdrawn from the market around the time that Tracktex was launched.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As noted above, Tracktex has a number of perceived advantages over sand. These include
                     (a) lower materials costs; (b) lower transportation costs; (c) lower installation
                     costs; (d) lower removal costs; and (e) less track downtime to perform installation.
                     In addition, a geotextile brings environmental advantages of decreased excavation
                     depth (thereby reducing spoil for landfill and the volume of traffic involved in removing
                     materials). Mr Donald gave evidence that he marketed these advantages to Network Rail
                     as benefits of Tracktex. As he pointed out, since Network Rail adopted the product,
                     it is only reasonable to assume that they accepted these benefits as genuine. This
                     view is also supported by a document from Network Rail dated 18 October 2010 which
                     shows the cost benefit of using Tracktex over a sand blanket (a Tracktex roll priced
                     at £11.45/m<sup>2</sup> produced a cost saving of approximately £765,908 over a stretch of track of about
                     24km). Mr Donald also said that Network Rail told him that Tracktex reduced track
                     possession time by about 33%. This can represent an even greater saving than the materials
                     costs saving, as possession of a mainline typically costs approximately £200,000 per
                     day.

                     agreement for Tracktex. There is a disclosure document headed “Tracktex - Marketing
                     Agreement” which records the terms by which the Claimant agreed to supply Tracktex
                     to Aqua. It is undated but seems to have been sent under cover of a letter from Mr
                     Donald to Ian Smith of Aqua on 7<sup>th</sup> April 2010. The terms included that the Claimant would supply Tracktex to Aqua exclusively
                     for the mainland UK (but excluding N. Ireland) save in respect of Network Rail’s right
                     to direct supply. The agreement could be terminated on 6 months’ notice by either
                     party. The price for 2010 was £15/m<sup>2</sup> ex works. As noted above (see paragraph 22), the idea was that Aqua would then sell
                     on to Network Rail at a price of £20/m<sup>2</sup>, although Mr Donald did not know what price Aqua in fact charged because the relationship
                     between the Claimant and Aqua was arm’s length. The first invoice to Aqua under this

                     from the Claimant. The MD Report from the Board Meeting of 25<sup>th</sup> October 2010 indicated that this was motivated by price, and that Network Rail were
                     keen to reduce the price of Tracktex to as low as £10/m<sup>2</sup>. These discussions continued into early 2011. In the MD Report of the Board Meeting
                     of 21<sup>st</sup> February 2011, Mr Donald recorded that he was considering this, but was “<i>mindful</i>” of the damage it could do to the relationship with Aqua, as well as Aqua’s ability

                     to Network Rail is dated 25<sup>th</sup> March 2011). The terms agreed between the Claimant and Network Rail are as set out

                     was Network Rail that had initiated this distribution agreement. The effect of the

                     from Network Rail) which made clear that Network Rail only anticipated supply of Tracktex
                     from Aqua for the short term. Mr Donald also confirmed that the Claimant had offered

                     as exclusivity in Ireland, Spain and Portugal. Enclosed with the letter was the proposed

                     clear that this was on “<i>preferential</i>” terms relative to Network Rail and expressed the hope that project work, international
                     business, London Underground and private lines would enable the Claimant and Aqua
                     to continue to develop a profitable Tracktex business together.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Donald explained that he did not want to leave Aqua without an opportunity in relation
                     to Tracktex and that he was very concerned to maintain a good relationship with it
                     despite the direct supply arrangement with Network Rail.  He also said that he knew
                     that there would be situations where sub-contractors would need or want to buy Tracktex
                     directly rather than obtaining it from Network Rail. He acknowledged that Aqua had
                     good relationships with sub-contractors and was much better set up to ship products
                     and service customers than the Claimant. Therefore, the best way for the Claimant
                     to handle this sector of the market was via Aqua.

                     right to direct supply under the Certificate of Approval, if it had wanted to continue

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By mid-2013, the Claimant was concerned that it would start trading at a loss. This
                     was partly due to the impact of Hydrotex 2 and the resulting lost Tracktex sales to
                     Network Rail. However, it was also partly due to market conditions which Mr Donald
                     fairly accepted in cross-examination had nothing to do with Hydrotex 2 or this case.
                     Overall, it meant that the Claimant was under significant commercial pressure. I return
                     to this in the context of Issue 4 and redundancies below.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By late 2013, and even though the Claimant successfully challenged the First Tender,
                     Mr Donald had formed the view that the Defendant would be likely to win the Second
                     Tender. He realised that would effectively exclude the Claimant from making direct
                     sales of Tracktex to Network Rail and mean that the only sales route available to
                     it was via sub-contractors. He was concerned to ensure that the Claimant was not left
                     without a route to market and recognised that Aqua was better placed than it was to
                     maintain this line of Tracktex sales. In this context, in the MD Report of the Board
                     Meeting of 23 September 2013, Mr Donald recorded as follows:

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In addition, since Aqua was also the distributor of the Claimant’s other geotextile
                     products which amounted to about 50% of the total business between them, he was concerned
                     to protect that too, particularly considering the market conditions. In cross-examination
                     he explained that if the Claimant lost the whole of the Aqua business, it would have
                     had an “<i>existential</i>” impact on the Claimant. As a result, the Claimant could not take the risk of falling
                     out with Aqua. It is important to remember, however, that one of the reasons why the
                     non-Tracktex sales were so important at the time was because of the potential impact
                     that Hydrotex 2 and the Second Tender were likely to have on the Tracktex side of
                     the business. Mr Donald pointed out in cross-examination that in the counterfactual
                     world where the Claimant had the additional Tracktex business, it would have been
                     significantly further away from a loss-making position.

                     to at paragraphs 33-34 above. This arrangement covered all sales of Tracktex, including
                     sales which were in fact made to Network Rail (despite the Second Tender).

                     did not issue a tender, the Claimant would have retained its direct supply agreement
                     with Network Rail. He said he could not see a reason why the Claimant would not have
                     continued to supply Network Rail direct, although it would have continued to use Aqua
                     as its distributor for non-Network Rail sales (including to sub-contractors who then
                     service Network Rail). He rejected the suggestion that the Claimant would have offered
                     an exclusive distribution agreement to Aqua. I accept Mr Donald’s evidence on this
                     issue, which seems to me to be founded on commercial common sense and was not undermined
                     by the cross-examination.

                     was at the instigation of Network Rail and there is no evidence that the Claimant
                     would ever have suggested it. However, that rather misses the point. The question
                     is not whether the direct supply agreement would ever have been put in place, since
                     it was in the actual and is deemed to be so in the counterfactual. Instead, the question
                     is whether the Claimant would have undone that arrangement in the counterfactual and
                     replaced it with an exclusive distribution agreement with Aqua instead.  I cannot
                     see why it would have been in the commercial interest of the Claimant to do that,
                     particularly bearing in mind that direct sales of Tracktex to Network Rail commanded
                     a higher price pursuant to the Network Rail price matrix (at least depending on the
                     quantities sold).

                     Rail had damaged the Claimant’s relationship with Aqua. There is no doubt that it
                     did. But the evidence showed that the Claimant had repeatedly made clear to Aqua that
                     it had been Network Rail’s doing. I refer to the letter of 15<sup>th</sup> March 2011, considered at paragraph 93 above. I also refer to the MD Report of the
                     Board Meeting dated 21<sup>st</sup> March 2011, where Mr Donald records that Aqua were not pleased that the Claimant
                     had entered into a direct supply arrangement with Network Rail but that he had stressed
                     to Aqua that this was a Network Rail initiative. In cross-examination, Mr Donald said
                     that Aqua felt that the Claimant “<i>had done the dirty on them</i>” which is why he had reassured them that it had come from Network Rail.

That is supported by the sales figures set out at paragraph 96 above. These figures
                     suggest that the overall arrangement was working reasonably well, and there is no
                     reason why the Claimant would have wanted to change it in the counterfactual.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant also relied on the fact that the Claimant entered into the exclusive
                     distribution agreement with Aqua on 6<sup>th</sup> December 2013. It submitted that this was because Aqua was not prepared to wait until
                     the outcome of the Second Tender and had put the Claimant under pressure for a more
                     favourable solution. It referred to the MD Report of the Board Meeting of 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2013 where Mr Donald records that since the last Board Meeting, he had
                     met with Aqua “<i>and definitely detected that the tactic of ‘wait and see’ was running out of time</i> <i>and that we were in danger of losing position through Aqua in the rail distribution
                        market</i>”. However, when Mr Donald was cross-examined about this, he explained that the “wait
                     and see” tactic had come from the Claimant and not Aqua and had been devised to buy
                     some time to assess the consequences of losing the First Tender whilst the tender
                     challenge process was under way. He also made clear that the key pressure was competition
                     from the Defendant in conjunction with market conditions at the time and losing the
                     First Tender. This situation would not have occurred in the counterfactual where there
                     would never have been competition from Hydrotex 2 or a tender process (even though
                     the other market conditions would have been the same). Absent competition from the
                     Defendant, the Claimant would not have needed to take remedial steps to ensure that
                     it continued to have access to the market and retained Aqua’s loyalty to Tracktex.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, in this context the Defendant referred to the fact that the Claimant has
                     continued its exclusive relationship with Aqua to this day, even though the tender
                     arrangement between Network Rail and the Defendant came to an end in July 2017 and
                     the exclusive distribution agreement with Aqua had an initial term of only three years.
                     The Defendant submitted that there has been nothing to stop the Claimant from selling
                     direct to Network Rail and said it is telling that it appears not to have even tried.
                     I do not think that there is anything in this point since it does not shed any light
                     on what the Claimant would have done in the counterfactual.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It follows that I reject the Defendant’s arguments that the Claimant would have offered
                     an exclusive distribution agreement to Aqua in respect of all Tracktex sales. On the
                     balance of probabilities, the Claimant would have continued the supply arrangements
                     that were in place immediately before Hydrotex 2 came onto the market, which comprised
                     direct supply to Network Rail and exclusive distribution via Aqua to contractors,
                     specific projects, and non-Network rail customers.

                     an exclusive distribution agreement, Aqua would have demanded one and the Claimant
                     would have had to agree to it. It puts the chance of this happening at about 25-33%,
                     although it accepts that the quantification of this chance must be assessed in the
                     round.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The foundation of the argument as expressed in the Defendant’s written closing was
                     that Aqua held tremendous bargaining power and there was no reason to suggest that
                     it would not have used it in the counterfactual to obtain an exclusive contract. It
                     contends that Aqua would have forced the Claimant to offer a deal, failing which it
                     would have walked away “because the Tracktex game was no longer worth the commercial
                     candle”. I have to say that I found this part of the Defendant’s case to be largely
                     speculative and unsupported by evidence. In this context, I note that there was no
                     evidence at all from Aqua itself, either in terms of disclosure or from witnesses.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">To the extent there was relevant evidence on this issue, it seemed to undermine the
                     Defendant’s case rather than support it. In particular, whilst there was clear evidence
                     in the Claimant’s disclosure that Aqua were unhappy with the direct supply arrangement
                     that Network Rail had imposed on the Claimant, there was no suggestion that Aqua were
                     threatening to walk away from the situation or to stop distribution of Tracktex to
                     non-Network Rail customers unless they had the benefit of complete exclusivity. To
                     the contrary, as soon as the direct supply arrangement with Network Rail was imposed
                     in 2011, the Claimant and Aqua were able to agree a new distribution arrangement with
                     the pricing matrix set out above and which was to operate alongside the direct supply
                     agreement between the Claimant and Network Rail. That arrangement was in place when
                     Hydrotex 2 was launched in July 2012 and, as I understand it, remained in place until
                     the December 2013 exclusive distribution agreement. Moreover, it was an arrangement
                     that worked well.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I appreciate that there was evidence from Mr Donald to the effect that both the Claimant
                     and Aqua wanted to enter into the December 2013 exclusive distribution agreement.
                     I have already explained above the reasons why that agreement was so important to
                     the Claimant at the time, but apart from residual damage to their relationship arising
                     out of the direct supply to Network Rail, none of those reasons would have materialised
                     in the counterfactual. There was no evidence to explain any additional reasons why
                     the agreement was important to Aqua or to suggest that Aqua had demanded it in the
                     actual. To the contrary, when it was put to Mr Donald in cross-examination that it
                     was Aqua that had pushed for the exclusive deal, he explained that it was the Claimant
                     who had offered it, but that of course the exclusivity was mutual in the sense that
                     Aqua only bought from the Claimant and the Claimant only supplied to Aqua. That evidence
                     was supported by the MD Report of the Board Meeting of 23<sup>rd</sup> September 2013, which recorded that Mr Donald had initiated discussions with Aqua
                     about a longer-term partnership and had recommended to the Board that the Claimant
                     tried to secure a deal with it.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant also relied on the evidence that by mid-2013 there were other market
                     pressures which were having a detrimental impact on the sale of non-Tracktex products
                     in any event. The Defendant pointed out that these pressures would have pertained
                     in the counterfactual, which I accept. However, as I have already noted above, in
                     the counterfactual the Claimant would have had greater sales from Tracktex with the
                     result that these pressures would not have been as significant. This is consistent
                     with the evidence of Mr Donald who accepted in cross-examination that the Claimant
                     would have done anything to protect the sales of non-Tracktex product in the actual
                     but rejected the suggestion that the position would be the same in the counterfactual.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, it was put to Mr Donald right at the end of his cross-examination that in
                     the counterfactual, there was a material chance that Aqua would not have “put up with”
                     a situation where the Claimant was supplying Tracktex directly to Network Rail and
                     Aqua only had sales to contractors. Mr Donald said that the chance of Aqua demanding
                     something different was even lower than the chance of Network Rail issuing a tender,
                     and the parties had agreed that would not have happened in the counterfactual.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For all these reasons, there was no material before me upon which I could conclude
                     that there was any real chance that Aqua would have demanded an exclusive distribution
                     agreement, and I reject this part of the Defendant’s case also.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I should note for completeness that Mr Hicks also argued that even if there was a
                     chance that Aqua would have demanded an exclusive distribution agreement in the counterfactual,
                     then the Claimant would have refused that demand on the balance of probabilities.
                     It was not put to Mr Donald in cross-examination that the Claimant would have agreed
                     to an exclusive distribution agreement if Aqua had demanded one, and there was no
                     other evidence to support this part of the Defendant’s case. Based on what I have
                     held above, I do not have to decide this point. However, in case it matters, I would
                     have held that it is more likely than not that the Claimant would have refused the
                     demand if it had been made. This is essentially for the same reasons that I have given
                     above in support of my view that the Claimant would not have been likely to offer
                     an exclusive distribution agreement. The Claimant would not have needed to accede
                     to such a demand, and it would not have been in its commercial interest to do so.

                     Claimant would have been in a monopoly position. In that situation, the Claimant argued
                     that every sale of Hydrotex 2 in the actual would have been a sale of Tracktex in
                     the counterfactual. To support this argument, it relied upon the following factors:

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Firstly, the Defendant relied on the fact that Tracktex was the first-in-class geocomposite
                     product, and that it needed to be accepted into a market that had been using sand
                     for years. In his written evidence, Mr Hancock said that in 2012 the advantages of
                     geocomposite products over sand were not as widely known as they are now, and that
                     there was a reluctance by some contractors to use them. He explained that one of the
                     reasons for this reluctance was safety; anti-pumping geocomposites were still new
                     technology and if they did not perform there could be serious consequences. Another
                     reason was a general resistance to change. He also explained that it was often the
                     contractors or sub-contractors who decided which anti-pumping solution to use.

                     this perception. Those efforts comprised attendance at trade fairs, the company website,
                     and an (unnamed) engineer working full time on promoting the Defendant’s products
                     (with about half that time spent on anti-pumping geocomposites). He gave evidence
                     that the Defendant was required to exert significant effort to secure sales, and he
                     estimated that about 30% of the Defendant’s sales were attributable solely to this
                     hard work. He said that he and his team only encountered competition from Aqua about
                     50% of the time, and on this basis, he thought that approximately 15% of the Defendant’s
                     sales would never have been made by the Claimant.

                     He accepted that he was not involved in the sale of Hydrotex 2 in the UK from 2015
                     to 2018, so he could not speak from first hand-knowledge about that period. He said
                     his evidence was based on his own experience from selling and promoting to Network
                     Rail engineers prior to 2015 and from feedback from colleagues in the field. Unfortunately,
                     he did not identify who these colleagues were, and I did not hear evidence from them.
                     I also did not see any contemporaneous documents which supported Mr Hancock’s evidence
                     that the Defendant was winning sales of Hydrotex 2 through its promotional efforts.

                     of the Defendant’s promotion of Hydrotex 2, but that he did not have any basis for
                     it.  He also accepted that promotional efforts were not required in respect of orders
                     from Network Rail, since they came in automatically. As a result, he agreed that any
                     such efforts only related to non-Network Rail sales. In my judgment, since approximately
                     85% of Hydrotex 2 sales were through Network Rail, the opportunity to win additional
                     sales through marketing and promotion must have been much more limited than Mr Hancock’s
                     evidence suggested.

                     or both. I accept this submission. In so doing, I am mindful of the warning from Norris

                     summarised at paragraph 66 above, I also have regard to the fact that it was the Defendant
                     who could have provided material to support its case on this issue, but it failed
                     to do so.

                     to the extent there is a point here at all, it only relates to the sales to contractors.
                     Mr Donald gave evidence that in the actual, if a contractor decided to use Hydrotex,
                     that was a clear indicator that they preferred a geocomposite over sand for that particular
                     project or piece of work.  He went on to say that if Hydrotex had not been available
                     (as in the counterfactual), there was no reason why the contractor would not have
                     selected Tracktex instead. The only other option would be to use sand, but that was
                     the more costly choice and there would be no logical reason to make it when a geocomposite
                     had been determined as a technically satisfactory option. (In this context, it will
                     be recalled that antipumping geocomposites are not suitable for all tracks.)

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Based on this evidence, the Claimant submitted that in the counterfactual, where Tracktex
                     was the only player in the market, the Claimant and Aqua would have been equally effective
                     in “converting” contractors to use it as the Defendant had been in the actual. I think
                     that there is force in this submission, particularly bearing in mind the significant
                     savings of cost and installation time over sand. It is also consistent with the contemporaneous
                     evidence to the effect that Aqua were good at converting contractors, for example
                     as noted by Mr Donald in his MD Report of the Board Meeting of 21<sup>st</sup> February 2011 (see paragraph 91 above), and as confirmed by him in cross-examination.

                     in the counterfactual. This was based on what the Defendant described as an “economic
                     principle” to the effect that generally when two suppliers enter the market for a
                     new (and as yet unaccepted) class of products, the market will grow faster than if
                     there is only one supplier. The experts agreed that, with an emerging product, a duopoly
                     can increase the growth of the market over and above the monopoly position.

                     grew after Hydrotex entered the market, with a peak in sales in around late 2015 to
                     early 2016. In its defence, the Defendant relied on the fact that Tracktex sales were
                     approximately 97 rolls per month prior to the launch of Hydrotex 2. It also claimed
                     that Network Rail had predicted annual sales of 1300 for 2013-2014, which amounts
                     to approximately 109 rolls per month. By contrast, the average number of rolls sold
                     between May 2013 and July 2021 was 204 rolls per month.

                     that by the time Hydrotex entered the market, Tracktex had already gained market acceptance
                     with Network Rail (even if some contractors remained reluctant).

                     and June 2017.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, a geocomposite product will only be used for remediation work when clay is
                           detected. The presence or absence of clay will vary across different geographic locations
                           and within different sections of a particular track. That explains why there is inherent
                           variability in how much product is used.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Secondly, the opportunity that geocomposites presented to remediate tracks at a much
                           lower cost and with reduced track possession time enabled Network Rail to address
                           pumping erosion issues that it might have otherwise not addressed. That may explain
                           a spike in sales over this period.

                           the Network Rail tender documents and would have been sufficient to cover approximately
                           20 miles of track. However, since Network Rail is responsible for about 14,500 miles
                           of track in total, it can readily be seen that even a small increase in remediation
                           work would reflect a large increase in sales.

                           800 rolls of geocomposite and would also have contributed to higher sales over this
                           period.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is difficult for me to assess to what extent, if at all, the growth in the market
                     in the actual was caused specifically by the presence of two geocomposite products
                     on the market, instead of one. On the one hand, I accept in principle that the advent
                     of a second product on to a new market can help to swell the overall size of that
                     market, particularly if it is still in the early stages of establishment and acceptance.
                     On the other hand, the evidence was that Tracktex had already gained acceptance, at
                     least by Network Rail, and its market was growing even before Hydrotex 2 was launched.
                     Mr Donald also gave cogent reasons to explain the spike in sales over 2015-2016. This
                     suggests that the pattern of growth in the actual would have been reflected in the

                     market that it could have achieved. I accept, of course, that there is such a relationship.
                     The point is explained in <i>Terrell on the Law of Patents </i>(19<sup>th</sup> Edition)<i> </i>at §21-114, a passage which Dr Pritchard helpfully referred me to. However, that does
                     not necessarily mean that the Claimant would not have secured more sales in the counterfactual
                     when it had a monopoly position, even with higher prices.

                     a reduction of around 15-20% but acknowledged that it was a matter of “feel” for the
                     court in light of the evidence and was not capable of precise mathematical calculation.

                     I was not persuaded that the Defendant had won any meaningful sales through its marketing
                     efforts with contractors which would not have otherwise come to the Claimant via Aqua.
                     The 15% figure proffered by Mr Hancock in this regard was speculation and was not
                     supported by any objective evidence. The Claimant would have achieved the direct orders
                     from Network Rail in any event. I was also not persuaded that the duopoly situation
                     in the actual grew the overall size of the market more than it would have done in
                     a monopoly situation in the counterfactual. I gave this point particular consideration
                     as I am aware that this argument has found favour in other cases (see in particular
                     Jacob J (as he then was) in <i>Gerber v Lectra </i>at p.415). But I must decide this case on the materials before me and in my view the

                     figures are based on the annual volumes that ran through each production line to manufacture
                     the actual volumes of Tracktex, Terratex and TED10 that the Claimant produced. This
                     was not clear from Mr Chapman’s report but was what Mr Donald said in his written
                     evidence. The counterfactual figures also include the total annual sales of Hydrotex

                     In this context, it relied on the spikes in sales that can be seen from the summary
                     of total invoices that Mr MacGregor prepared as part of his evidence:

                           other products (96% for 2013) and the variation in production of those other products
                           will have a much greater effect on overall usage and capacity.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Donald accepted that if there was significant demand for the other products in

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I think that this argument is flawed for a number of reasons. Firstly, Mr MacGregor’s
                     graph relates to invoices and hence reflects monthly variability in sales, not production.
                     Secondly, the proportion of line usage for other products is the wrong comparator.
                     What matters is the total remaining capacity in the actual, and whether that was sufficient
                     to accommodate the additional manufacturing requirements in the counterfactual. Thirdly,
                     whilst Mr Donald did accept that there was a potential to run out of capacity, he
                     made clear that was only in theory. His evidence was that it was unlikely to happen
                     in practice. He pointed to the fact that in the last 10-12 years, the factory had
                     not even had to work at the weekend to meet production demands. He also explained
                     that there were levels of protection (he called them “safety valves”) to ensure consistent
                     supply: (i) Aqua retained their own stock of Tracktex which they used to meet their
                     customer demand. They replenished their stock via stock orders every few months; (ii)
                     Aqua’s stock orders usually had a lead time of 6-8 weeks and were not for immediate
                     supply; (iii) the Claimant also kept stock of Tracktex (typically 100 rolls) in case
                     of last-minute orders.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant also criticised the Claimant for not having provided the monthly production
                     data upon which the annual data set out at paragraph 145 above was based. As a result,
                     it submitted that the Claimant had failed to prove that it had the capacity to make
                     the additional sales it would have achieved in the counterfactual. Dr Pritchard pointed
                     out that this was information that the Claimant had but had failed to provide and
                     reminded me of the authorities set out at paragraph 64 above.

                     the totally of evidence was sufficient for the Claimant to discharge the burden of
                     proof on this issue. The annual figures demonstrated that there was ample head room
                     to manufacture the total quantity of Tracktex in the counterfactual. Moreover, the
                     concerns about monthly variations seemed more theoretical than real, particularly
                     bearing in mind the normal lead time on orders which would enable production to be
                     spread over a period of weeks (if so required) and the stock of Tracktex that the
                     Claimant held to meet any urgent demands.

                     prices would have been different, but there is significant dispute about the detail
                     of how these prices should be estimated.

                     counterfactual – Issue 3); (ii) lost profits on sales of Tracktex in the actual (assuming
                     these were at lower prices than would have been achieved in the counterfactual); and
                     (iii) lost profits on future sales which requires an estimation of what the sales
                     price of Tracktex would have been in the counterfactual in May 2021 when Hydrotex

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, there was a small point of detail here which remained in dispute. Based on
                     the matrix, the Claimant submitted that the Network Rail starting price for Tracktex
                     in the counterfactual should be £10.90/m<sup>2</sup> whereas the Defendant said it should be £11/m<sup>2</sup>. The discrepancy arises because Mr MacGregor calculated the average sales price for
                     2011/2012 over a 13-month period to reflect the fact that the Claimant had extended
                     the 2011/2012 contractual period by one month in the actual. This had been done at
                     the time to allow Network Rail to achieve total sales of over 1000 rolls and take
                     advantage of the lowest price band of the matrix. Network Rail had received a rebate
                     of £54,705 as a result. Mr MacGregor took this rebate into account in his calculation
                     of the average sales price. Mr Chapman’s calculation was based on sales over the 12-month
                     period of 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012, although it did take the rebate into account.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I prefer Mr MacGregor’s approach on this issue, for no other reason than it is anchored
                     in the actual. I think it is likely that the Claimant would have approached the first
                     year of pricing with Network Rail in the counterfactual in the same way that it did
                     in the actual. The task of estimating what would have happened in the counterfactual
                     is uncertain enough as it is, and it would be foolish to exacerbate that by ignoring
                     what happened in the real world.

                     is perhaps worth emphasising that it was common ground that non-Network Rail sales
                     of Tracktex in the counterfactual would have been made through Aqua, as they were
                     in the actual. This means that even though I have held that there would not have been
                     an exclusive distribution arrangement between the Claimant and Aqua in the counterfactual,
                     with the result that the Claimant would have made direct sales to Network Rail, it
                     is still necessary to determine the price of sales to Aqua for the purposes of calculating
                     the damages in respect of non-Network Rail sales.

                     MacGregor assumed that Aqua would have to purchase Tracktex from the Claimant at a
                     price that was lower than the price agreed with Network Rail in order to remain competitive
                     when selling to contractors. He arrived at the figure of 23% by calculating the average
                     mark-up that Aqua had applied to sales of Tracktex in the actual, which he assessed
                     at about 30% (a mark-up of 30% is mathematically equivalent to a discount of 23%).
                     The 30% figure itself was based on a range of sources, as follows:

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have a number of difficulties with the Defendant’s suggested approach. First, in
                     the actual the Claimant did not use the Network Rail pricing matrix to determine the
                     prices that it charged to Aqua. Instead, it used a different pricing matrix specific
                     to Aqua. Secondly, there was no evidence to support the view that the Claimant would
                     have changed its approach in the counterfactual. Thirdly, there was no evidence of
                     the prices that Aqua in fact charged in the actual. As noted above, Mr Donald did
                     not know, because the relationship between the Claimant and Aqua was arm’s length.
                     This means that the 30% figure is based on supposition. Fourthly, during the period
                     between about April 2011 and December 2013 when the Claimant was supplying to Aqua
                     and Network Rail in parallel, the average Tracktex prices to Aqua were higher than
                     the average prices to Network Rail (presumably reflecting the different volumes that
                     they bought). The Defendant’s sales prices of Hydrotex 2 to Keyline were also higher
                     on average than its prices to Network Rail. This evidence undermines the assumption
                     that prices to Aqua in the counterfactual should necessarily be lower than prices
                     to Network Rail. Mr Hicks also explained that contractors are prepared to pay higher
                     prices from distributors because of the additional services they offer (such as distribution,
                     additional products, ready stocks, etc).

                     would have used the Aqua pricing matrix in the counterfactual in circumstances where
                     it was more likely that there would have been an exclusive distribution arrangement
                     between them. I have already rejected this argument, above.

                     superseded by the approach he set out in his second report. I therefore focus my analysis

                     above (MacGregor 1 vs Chapman 2).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The question of whether the price increase would have been the same or different for
                     Network Rail and Aqua is interrelated with what that estimated price increase would
                     be. Mr MacGregor’s 1.7% figure was calculated by reference to all Hydrotex sales,
                     whereas Mr Chapman based his 4.73% figure on Hydrotex sales to Network Rail and his
                     2.86% figure on Hydrotex sales to Keyline. For this reason, it is more logical to
                     determine the sub-issue of whether the same or different annual price increases would
                     have applied to Network Rail and non-Network Rail sales in the counterfactual first,
                     before going on to assess what the price increase or increases would likely have been.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, the annual price increase in the counterfactual should be assessed
                     independently for Network Rail and Aqua. I think that this is an inevitable consequence
                     of the decision I have reached above to the effect that the Claimant would have used
                     the Network Rail price matrix for sales to Network Rail and the Aqua price matrix
                     for sales to Aqua.  Once one accepts that the Network Rail and non-Network Rail prices
                     were negotiated differently, in my view one must also accept that it is more likely
                     they will be subject to different average annual price increases.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I should note that my reason for reaching this view is not the same as the main reason
                     that Mr Chapman gave in his report for determining the price increase for the Network
                     Rail and non-Network Rail sales separately. His justification for splitting the sales
                     was that the Hydrotex sales to Network Rail were more reflective of the monopoly situation
                     that would pertain in the counterfactual. However, the Defendant was critical of this
                     view. Dr Pritchard pointed out that the sales of Hydrotex to Network Rail took place
                     in two distinct periods. The first period was pursuant to the tender framework when
                     prices were fixed and there was effectively no price growth. The second period was
                     once the Second Tender had come to an end, after which there was an immediate price
                     spike (presumably representing market freedom outside the tender framework), followed
                     eventually by more stable price growth akin to that of the non-Network Rail sales.
                     During this second period, Hydrotex was also being sold to Network Rail in competition
                     with Tracktex.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In cross-examination, Mr Chapman accepted that the Hydrotex sales to Network Rail
                     as a whole were not reflective of a quasi-monopoly position. He agreed that to the
                     extent there was a monopoly situation in the actual, it was only during the period
                     of the tender framework.

                     make any comparison less than perfect. But in my view, assessing the price increase
                     of Tracktex sales to Network Rail and Aqua separately is the most logical approach
                     in all the circumstances of the case.

                     to Network Rail in the counterfactual. The rationale for this approach was that the
                     Claimant would have achieved at least the same rate of price increase in the counterfactual
                     (when Tracktex would have been in a monopoly position) as the Defendant had achieved
                     in the actual (when Hydrotex had encountered some competition from Tracktex, at least
                     once the Second Tender period had come to an end).

                     There were a number of reasons for this, as follows.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Firstly, the Defendant submitted that the best estimate of the annual price increase
                     in the counterfactual was the evidence from Mr Donald rather than the models proposed
                     by the experts. In his Third Witness Statement, Mr Donald had said that based on his
                     experience of sales of products in the sector, an average annual rise in price of
                     2% p.a. seemed a reasonable assumption. He calculated that this would have meant an
                     average price of £12/m<sup>2</sup> in 2013, increasing to £13.79/m<sup>2</sup> in 2020. Whilst he did not say so expressly, the inference is that he considered
                     those prices to be reasonable. He also sense-checked the 2% figure against the CPI,
                     CPIH and RPI values for the years 2013-2020, and considered it to be comparable on
                     average to those values. By his Sixth Witness Statement, Mr Donald’s evidence was
                     that his aim would have been to secure a price increase of 2-5% each year to match
                     the yearly increase in the cost of a sand blanket. However, he accepted in cross-examination
                     that 2% was a “safer” figure, and he said it was the best figure to take based on
                     his own commercial experience.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I do not think that I should determine the likely annual price increase by reference
                     to this evidence alone, as the Defendant submitted, but I obviously take it into account
                     in my overall assessment of what the average annual price increase would likely have
                     been. However, I also bear in mind that, as Mr Hicks pointed out, the 2% figure was
                     based on an average price in 2013 of £12/m<sup>2</sup>, which is higher than the deemed price in the counterfactual from the Network Rail
                     price matrix.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Secondly, Mr Chapman’s calculation of the start price was based on the sales from
                     May 2013 to March 2014, whereas Mr MacGregor based his on sales from July to December
                     2013.<sup>2</sup> Mr MacGregor excluded the first two months of initial sales (May - June 2013) because
                     they were at a price of £7.95. Within a couple of months, the Hydrotex price had risen
                     to £9.50 and whilst there was some fluctuation thereafter, it never went as low as
                     £7.95 again. As a result, Mr MacGregor considered that these initial prices were given
                     at a discounted rate so that the Defendant could enter the market. In his view, there
                     would not have been an equivalent dip in the Tracktex price in the counterfactual,
                     since by then it would have already been on the market for some time and would have
                     an established price in accordance with the Network Rail price matrix.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Chapman agreed in principle that the calculation should exclude data that was peculiar
                     to Hydrotex in the real world and would not have been relevant to the counterfactual.
                     However, he did not accept that the initial Hydrotex price was an anomaly. In his
                     view, it was simply the price that the Defendant started selling at, and so was the
                     proper basis against which to assess the average increase in price. He thought that
                     the rationale behind the pricing was irrelevant.

                     that the £7.95 price was a discounted one or that there was something unusual about
                     it. Nor was there any disclosure from the Defendant which shed any light on this issue.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Hicks submitted that Mr MacGregor’s approach was akin to “cherry picking”. The
                     thrust of the submission was that Mr MacGregor was ignoring the early sales because
                     they skewed the figure in the Claimant’s favour. Mr Hicks also pointed out that Mr
                     MacGregor’s approach was contrary to the desire which both experts shared to include
                     as much data as possible over as large a time frame as possible. Finally, he said
                     it would be inconsistent for the court to disregard the May-June sales of Hydrotex
                     on the basis that they were the Defendant’s starting prices in circumstances where
                     the Network Rail pricing matrix comprised the Claimant’s first prices to Network Rail.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I found this difficult to decide, as there is force in both side’s approaches. However,
                     on balance, in my judgment it would be wrong to exclude the May and June sales from
                     the determination of the average starting sales price, particularly when there was
                     no evidence from Mr Hancock to support the idea that they were discounted prices or
                     an outlier. I prefer Mr Chapman’s approach to the calculation of the average starting
                     sales price for the purposes of the growth rate formula.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thirdly, Mr Chapman’s average final sales price was based on the sales period of 1
                     April 2021 – 22 July 2021. I presume this was because the pricing matrices ran from
                     1 April in each calendar year. There were only three sales of Hydrotex to Network
                     Rail in this period, amounting to just over 4000 sqm.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr MacGregor considered that this three-month period was too short and did not provide
                     a large enough sample from which to calculate a meaningful average price. As a result,
                     he had calculated the average final sales price from the sales figures for the six-month
                     period from January to June 2021. So far as I understand it from Mr MacGregor’s evidence,
                     he excluded the July 2021 sales figures because they comprised sales at £nil value
                     and this would have distorted the average. I note that Mr Chapman had adopted a similar
                     approach in his first report (albeit that his first calculation is no longer relied
                     upon).

                     period was a small number and looked like an outlier. He also agreed that Mr MacGregor’s

                     prices on Mr Chapman’s calculation in conjunction with the small number of sales overall.
                     I also did not understand why there were July 2021 sales at all when the Court of

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourthly, Mr Chapman based his calculation on a total period of 8.22 years of sales
                     (May 2013 to July 2021), which results in a period of sales price growth (P) of 7.22
                     years. By contrast, Mr MacGregor based his calculation on a total period of 8 years
                     of sales (July 2013 to June 2021), which results in a period of sales price growth
                     (P) of 7 years. The experts agreed that the period should be based on the longest
                     possible period of reliable data. If the May-June 2013 prices are included in the
                     SP calculation and the July 2021 prices are excluded from the FP calculation, which
                     is my preferred approach, then the period of sales price growth is 7.16 years. I have
                     calculated this figure by adding 0.25 (being the three-month period April 2021 to
                     June 2021) to 6.91 (being the figure for the period to the end of the 2020/2021 period

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant also argued that the annual average price increase would not be much
                     more than around 1.7% - 2% because of price pressures from Network Rail. It relied
                     on the fact that in the actual, the Claimant had succumbed to significant pressure
                     from Network Rail to reduce the Tracktex price in 2011. It also relied on the evidence
                     from Mr MacGregor where he said that in a one seller one buyer market, he would expect
                     the larger entity (in this case Network Rail) to have significantly more bargaining
                     power. Mr MacGregor did not support this opinion with any further reasoning or evidence,
                     and so it is difficult to place much weight on it. Whilst there is no doubt that Network
                     Rail was by far the larger commercial entity, and it would have been the Claimant’s
                     primary customer for Tracktex, there is no objective evidence to suggest that these
                     factors would have given it the upper hand in its negotiations with the Claimant in
                     the counterfactual. In this context, I bear in mind that the Claimant would have been
                     the only supplier of an anti-pumping geocomposite in the counterfactual and that the
                     product offered several advantages over the only alternative of a sand blanket, including
                     significant cost savings. Network Rail was behind the product and would have wanted
                     to buy it. I also bear in mind that the Defendant was able to resist pressure from
                     Network Rail to reduce its prices as between the First and Second Tenders and won
                     the Second Tender even though its prices for Hydrotex 2 were the same as the First
                     Tender. As a result, I consider that the Claimant and Network Rail would have had
                     equal bargaining positions in the counterfactual.

                     the FP figure using Mr MacGregor’s approach but based on the Network Rail sales alone.
                     However, I formed the view that it was not necessary to do that for the following
                     reasons. Firstly, the growth rate formula is simply an accounting tool that can be
                     used to estimate annual percentage price growth. It does not provide <i>the</i> answer; it is no more than an aid to the court in reaching a view as to what the
                     annual average price increase in the counterfactual would likely have been. Secondly,
                     I was concerned not to add any further cost and delay to what I think has already
                     been a complicated and time-consuming exercise in assessing damages. Thirdly, both
                     parties impressed upon me that the task of assessing the likely annual price increase
                     is not one that can be done with any precision (see above).

                     the actual. However, there was no evidence about the nature of the Defendant’s relationship
                     with Keyline, so I have no means of assessing what factors influenced the prices that
                     the Defendant was able to charge in the actual or how those factors compare with the
                     situation between the Claimant and Aqua in the counterfactual. In this instance, I

                     the market. He said that his intention at the time was to establish product credibility
                     and volumes on the market. Then, as the product proved itself in use and the industry
                     started to appreciate the costs savings that it provided, his plan was to increase
                     prices through new price matrices. Whilst I accept this evidence as far as it goes,
                     it does not shed any further light on how frequently the price matrices would have
                     been reviewed and whether prices would have gone up annually or every two years.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It follows that I hold that in the counterfactual, the Trackex price to Network Rail
                     would have increased every two years whereas the Tracktex price to Aqua would have
                     increased every year.  This is because it reflects what happened in the actual, albeit
                     that the matrices were only used over a limited period.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his first report, Mr MacGregor had referred to and relied upon a document from
                     the Claimant’s disclosure dated 11<sup>th</sup> March 2011 entitled “Distribution Agreement” which suggested that the Claimant had
                     agreed a rebate scheme with Network Rail. However, Mr Donald explained that this document
                     was an unfinished draft which got superseded by the 15<sup>th</sup> March 2011 price matrix I set out at paragraph 23 above and that the Claimant never
                     agreed a rebate scheme with Network Rail. This evidence was not challenged by the
                     Defendant, and I accept that the Claimant would not have agreed a rebate scheme with
                     Network Rail in the counterfactual.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, the Defendant maintained that sales of Tracktex to Aqua would have been subject
                     to a rebate scheme. This argument was based on a disclosure document in which the
                     Claimant confirmed to Aqua the details of the 2014 Annual Rebate Scheme. This was
                     a scheme that gave Aqua a % rebate depending on the value of Tracktex sales that the
                     Claimant made to it. Mr Donald explained in cross-examination that this scheme was
                     in place after the pricing matrix had been dropped and the Claimant was simply selling
                     to Aqua on a price per square metre.  The idea behind the rebate scheme was to incentivise
                     Aqua to buy more.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, there would have been no need for the Claimant to provide the same
                     rebate scheme in the counterfactual since Aqua would have been purchasing Tracktex
                     pursuant to the Aqua pricing matrix and that already provided an incentive to buy
                     more by means of the pricing bands. Accordingly, I reject the Defendant’s argument
                     on this issue. The Aqua sales should not be subject to a rebate as part of the damages
                     calculation.

                     to calculate the pricing matrices in the counterfactual, based on the various issues
                     that I have now determined (starting point, growth rate, etc). Mr MacGregor’s loss
                     model approached the calculation on the basis of the number of rolls sold each year
                     in the counterfactual, whereas Mr Chapman’s model approached the calculation on the
                     basis of the total quantity in metres squared. Mr Chapman explained that his approach
                     was adopted to simplify the calculation. However, he assumed that all rolls are 97.5m<sup>2</sup>, whereas this is only correct for the 3.9m width roll.  The 3.7m roll is 92.5m<sup>2</sup> and the 3.5m roll is 87.5m<sup>2</sup>. As a result, his approach included unnecessary inaccuracy. In addition, Mr MacGregor
                     pointed out that in the actual, price matrices were done based on the numbers of rolls
                     sold, which is why he thought that was the better way to approach the calculation
                     for the counterfactual.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, there was a debate about whether the experts should calculate the damages
                     figure based on a consistent annual growth rate after March 2019. Assuming that the
                     Network Rail price matrix was reviewed biennially, this date would have been the first
                     “new” pricing matrix in the counterfactual after the Second Tender had come to an
                     end in July 2017 in the actual. When that happened, there was a price spike which
                     Mr MacGregor considered was likely to have been caused by the Defendant’s freedom
                     to charge higher prices once it was no longer subject to the tender framework. Since
                     that would not have occurred in the counterfactual, he thought it was more appropriate
                     to assume that the last two years of sales (2019-2021) were based on the maximum sales
                     price the Claimant could have charged rather than by reference to annual growth.

                     In particular, it was not clear why one assumption was any better than the other in
                     circumstances where the maximum sales price that the Claimant could have charged was
                     itself calculated by reference to the estimated % annual growth. Moreover, I am not
                     convinced that the point requires determination in light of the other findings I have
                     already made. In the circumstances, I prefer not to express a view but will wait to
                     hear further from the parties in the context of providing directions for the damages

                     and September 2013. This reduced the head count of the business by eight people or
                     28% of the workforce. Of the employees that were made redundant, one was a development
                     manager, two were sales support staff and five were production staff.

                     one-off cost of these redundancies was £74,000, of which £32,976 was attributable

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is a dispute on the evidence as to which of these redundancies were attributable
                     to the downturn in the Claimant’s business caused by the infringement and resulting
                     lost sales of Tracktex. The costs savings from redundancies in the actual that would

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Claimant’s case is that the three support staff (the development manager and two
                     sales support) would have been made redundant anyway. It accepts that not all the
                     production staff would have been made redundant and puts the figure at one third of
                     those five staff. This would result in a deduction of £189,008. This is calculated
                     as follows: [(7.5 x £80,000) - £32,976]/3, where 7.5 years is the total period of

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendant’s primary case is that none of the redundancies would have happened
                     in the counterfactual, with the result that the annual savings they generated for
                     the Claimant should be deducted from the final damages figure. This would result in
                     a deduction of £1,426,000. This is calculated as follows: [(7.5 x £200,000) - £74,000].
                     The Defendant’s alternative case is that even if some redundancies would have been
                     made, it would have been no more than a third of the total eight staff. This would
                     result in a deduction of £475,333. This is calculated as follows: [(7.5 x £200,000)
                     - £74,000]/3.

                     deducted from the overall damages figure that the Claimant can recover. The parties
                     are agreed that it is only costs savings that the Claimant made in the actual from

                     Tracktex sales; it would have been cementing a long-term relationship with Network

                     it was an unpleasant process, he would have wanted to avoid it. Whilst Mr Donald agreed,
                     he went on to explain that the sales support staff would have been made redundant
                     in any event, consistently with what he had said in his written evidence. I accept
                     this evidence. He was not specifically asked about the development manager, but since
                     that employee fell into the same category as the sales support staff for the reasons
                     Mr Donald gave in his written evidence, I accept that he/she would also have been
                     made redundant in the counterfactual. Mr Donald also explained that it was possible
                     to slim down the fixed costs of production because there was additional production
                     capacity as required through overtime.

                     the actual. Mr Donald agreed with this suggestion, which is obviously correct, but
                     it does not mean that it was the only reason or that the other reasons he gave were
                     not also “key”. He was not challenged on the other reasons he had given in his written
                     evidence, which were consistent with the MD Report of the Board Meeting of 24<sup>th</sup> June 2013 to which I was referred. This recorded as follows:

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In light of this evidence, I find that the development manager and the sales support
                     staff would have been made redundant in the counterfactual. These individuals concerned
                     were not involved in the Tracktex side of the business and the redundancies had nothing
                     to do with the infringement. As a result, despite the painful nature of the redundancy
                     process, I consider that it is more likely than not that these redundancies would
                     have happened regardless. It follows that I reject the Defendant’s primary case and
                     decline to make any reduction in the overall damages figure based on the £120,000
                     annual savings the Claimant made from these three redundancies.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, it is more difficult to assess whether any of the production staff would
                     also have been made redundant in the counterfactual, and if so, how many. The Claimant’s
                     justification for the argument that one third of the production staff would not have
                     been made redundant is that the presence of Hydrotex 2 on the market was one of three
                     reasons recorded in the Board Minutes that had prompted the redundancies.  Mr Hicks
                     submitted that this figure was generous to the Defendant bearing in mind that only
                     4% of the Claimant’s production was attributable to Tracktex.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Dr Pritchard argued that the introduction of Hydrotex 2 was the tipping point that
                     had effectively triggered the redundancy programme. He reminded me that in the counterfactual,
                     the Claimant would have had the benefit of additional Tracktex sales in 2013 (estimated
                     to be approximately £800,000 - £1million) as well as the promise of future income
                     and security from the monopoly position it would have commanded. He also relied on
                     Mr Donald’s evidence that the redundancy process was extremely painful, and that he
                     would have kept the staff if the circumstances had justified keeping them.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have found this a difficult issue as the arguments were finely balanced. However,
                     doing the best I can on the materials before me, I think it is more likely than not
                     that the Claimant would still have made some production staff redundant in the counterfactual.
                     In this context I bear in mind that there were other reasons beyond the impact of
                     Hydrotex 2 that were contributing to the financial pressures of the Claimant which
                     would still have occurred in any event. I also bear in mind that only 4% of the Claimant’s
                     production was attributable to Tracktex, which means that it is unlikely that the
                     Claimant would have needed to retain all five of the production staff, even allowing
                     for the additional Tracktex production that would have been required in the counterfactual.
                     As noted above, Mr Donald also explained that there was extra production capacity
                     through overtime as required.

                     some redundancies in the counterfactual, the costs savings would be calculated on
                     the basis that they were a third of the costs savings in the actual. As can be seen
                     above, the reason that the parties propose different figures is that the Claimant’s
                     sum is limited to the costs savings of the production staff in the actual, whereas
                     the Defendant’s sum is based on the total costs savings of all eight staff.

                     that the development manager and sales support staff would have been made redundant
                     in any event. This finding means that only the costs savings attributable to the production
                     staff are relevant to calculating the figure that should be deducted from the final
                     damages sum.

                     to reflect the savings that it made from redundancies that would not have occurred

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Claimant argues that if Hydrotex 2 had never been on the market, then in May/June
                     2021 when Hydrotex 4 was launched, Tracktex would have been selling at a higher price
                     in the counterfactual than in the actual. Moreover, it contends that it would have
                     taken about two years for the price of Tracktex to fall to a real-world price. As
                     a result, the Claimant claims that the historic presence of Hydrotex 2 on the market
                     will have an impact on future sales, even after Hydrotex 2 was removed, until about
                     June 2023.

                     new product with no track record. This was in marked contrast to what happened when
                     Hydrotex 4 was launched in the actual. When Hydrotex 4 was actually launched in May
                     2021, that was off the back of established trading of Hydrotex 2, and the Defendant
                     was able to exploit the sales and distribution channels and trading reputation it
                     had already acquired with respect to that product. Mr Donald referred to the fact

                     4, treating the new product simply as a replacement of the original. He says that

                     its low in December 2013. Mr Chapman adopts this two-year time period in his calculations
                     without further analysis or comment.

                     as two years for the Tracktex price to reduce to real-world prices when faced with
                     competition from Hydrotex 4. Its primary position was based on Mr MacGregor’s opinion
                     that the Claimant would have immediately lowered the Tracktex price to match that
                     of Hydrotex 4 so as to stop Network Rail simply shifting its custom to the Defendant
                     instead.

                     in the actual from the moment that Hydrotex 2 was introduced. It submitted that Network
                     Rail took what it describes as a “very aggressive attitude to price reduction” in
                     the actual and said that there is every reason to believe that it would have forced
                     the price down at the earliest opportunity in the counterfactual.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is no doubt that Network Rail was proactive about obtaining the best possible
                     price in the actual, although there is no evidence to suggest that its attitude was
                     aggressive as such. Nevertheless, I accept that it is likely that it would have used
                     the presence of Hydrotex 4 on the market as an opportunity to obtain more competitive
                     prices with the Claimant. I do not accept, however, that this would have achieved
                     an immediate price reduction. In my view, this suggestion (which comes from Mr MacGregor’s
                     report) is unreal. It ignores the fact that in the counterfactual, Tracktex would
                     have had an established track record of over 10 years whereas Hydrotex 4 was a complete
                     unknown. Mr Hancock accepted in cross-examination that people are creatures of habit
                     and are unlikely to change from Tracktex without being persuaded that Hydrotex 4 was
                     a suitable alternative (in terms of product efficiency, ease of installation, supply,
                     etc). It also ignores the lead time on projects and orders. Even with price pressure
                     from Network Rail, I think that it is much more likely that the Claimant would have
                     reduced the Tracktex price on a gradual basis, and only then once Hydrotex 4 had started
                     to gain some traction in the market.

                     with his assumption that the Tracktex price was depressed in the actual from about

                     was some price depression on the average sales price to Aqua but not to Network Rail.
                     This reinforces the view that the Claimant would not have immediately reduced the
                     Tracktex price to Network Rail in the counterfactual once Hydrotex 4 was launched.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The chart also showed that once the Aqua price started to reduce, it took approximately
                     12 months (Q2 2013 to Q2 2014) to reach its lowest point and possibly a further six
                     months to stabilise (although this is hard to tell as the chart stops at Q4 2014).
                     This may shed some light on how long it would have taken for the Tracktex price to
                     go from the future counterfactual price (i.e. the price at May 2021, before Hydrotex
                     4 was on the market) to the future actual world price (i.e. the estimated price that
                     Tracktex will be sold in the actual when prices have stabilised) once the price started
                     to go down. If it took approximately five months before the Tracktex price was reduced
                     at all (as Mr Chapman suggested) and then about a further 12-18 months before the
                     reductions came to an end and the price stabilised, the time over which depression
                     had occurred would be approximately two years. This is consistent with the Claimant’s
                     case on this sub-issue.

                     with Aqua in December 2013. This submission was based on Mr MacGregor’s view that
                     the price depression had been caused by price pressure applied by Aqua as well as
                     the infringement. As a result, he had thought that it would be more appropriate to

                     is equally problematic. In particular, even if the Tracktex sales are a poor proxy
                     for the reasons Mr MacGregor gives, I do not understand why the Hydrotex 2 sales are
                     any better. They are subject to their own vagaries, such as the price spike after
                     the end of the Second Tender, which mean that they are also a poor proxy.

                     assessment separately for Network Rail and Aqua, which is consistent with my findings
                     above. As a result, I think it is more convenient to use his calculations (subject
                     to the necessary amendments in light of my other decisions) thereby making the process
                     of calculating the overall damages figure more efficient and proportionate. I think
                     that it is legitimate to take these considerations into account when there is so little

                     Aqua had got the deal done first. I have to say that I found that evidence rather
                     more surprising, particularly bearing in mind (i) the scale of the project, which
                     would have made it an attractive contract for any supplier; and (ii) the fact that
                     the Defendant had a dedicated salesperson for the South East (a Mr Dave Dutton) which
                     would have included this project. As Mr Hicks pointed out, his written evidence had
                     not given this impression; to the contrary, it had even referred to one order that
                     the Defendant had received for Crossrail. However, I understand that there is a difference
                     between bidding for the Crossrail supply contract as a whole and meeting a one-off
                     order, and his evidence was not addressing the former. When questioned, Mr Hancock
                     said that he had checked his files and had no record of Hydrotex being put forward
                     for Crossrail. He also said that he would have known if Dave Dutton had made a bid,
                     since he was Mr Dutton’s manager at the time.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Ultimately, the question as to whether the Defendant bid for the Crossrail project
                     does not matter, although if I had needed to decide the point, I would have accepted
                     Mr Hancock’s evidence. What matters is the reason why the Claimant agreed the price
                     it did with Aqua in order to secure the Crossrail contract. The Claimant submitted
                     that it was because of general price competition which had been caused by Hydrotex
                     2. Mr Hicks argued that such price competition was foreseeable, including in the form
                     of a contractor seeking to use the presence of competition on the market as a negotiating
                     tactic to achieve lower prices.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, in my judgment, it was the specific information that the Defendant was offering
                     Hydrotex 2 at a price of £6.50/m<sup>2</sup> that led the Claimant to agree to supply Tracktex to Aqua for the Crossrail project
                     at the same price. The MD Report makes that clear. That information came from Aqua,
                     who no doubt had its own commercial motivations for providing it and obtaining the
                     lowest possible price it could. In this context, it is to be remembered that the Claimant’s
                     relationship with Aqua was arm’s length, and the Claimant did not know what price
                     Aqua supplied Tracktex to Balfour Beatty.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Whilst I accept that general price competition was foreseeable, I do not think that
                     the information from Aqua falls into that category. This is highlighted by the fact
                     that the standard price the Claimant was selling Tracktex to Aqua – that price itself
                     being the result of general price competition from Hydrotex 2 – was £9.50/m<sup>2</sup>.  Nor was it foreseeable that the Claimant would offer such a significant price reduction
                     (nearly 30%) on the basis of such information without checking its accuracy first.
                     Moreover, the information from Aqua is itself an intervening cause over which the
                     Defendant had no control. It is not something for which the Defendant ought fairly
                     to be held liable.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It follows that the loss caused by the £6.50 Crossrail price was too remote and cannot
                     be recovered, and I so hold. In reaching this view, I have carefully considered the
                     guidance set out in <i>Kuwait Airways </i>(which was the only authority to which I was referred on this point) and have paid
                     particular attention to the sequence of events that led up to the Claimant’s loss
                     so as to identify the happening which should be regarded as causing the loss for the
                     purposes of allocating responsibility.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I understand that Mr MacGregor’s loss model allows for the Crossrail price to be adjusted
                     to an average sales price that the Claimant charged Aqua in the year of the transaction,
                     that average sales price itself based on sales figures that exclude Crossrail. This
                     has been done so that the Crossrail price anomaly does not skew the average value.
                     Based on this approach, when the loss on the Crossrail sales is calculated, the Defendant
                     will only pay for any price depression caused by the infringement. This approach was
                     not challenged by the Claimant, and so I take it that it is not in dispute.

                  but that there are very small differences between some of them (1-3%). It is not clear
                  what the reason is for these differences. I have used Mr Donald’s figures as they
                  are consistently higher.
