                     Community design and of unregistered UK design rights in the design for a knee length
                     ladies’ boot. The design is based upon a traditional Spanish riding boot. I have to
                     decide, in essence, whether three versions of the design sold (sequentially) by the
                     First Defendant infringe the Claimants’ registered and unregistered designs.

                     is a slim fitting, elegant, knee-length boot with a mid-height heel, a full zip on
                     the outside of the leg, with a tassel pull, and a ‘fan’ above it. Whilst the boot
                     is in the style of a Spanish riding boot, it was not designed for serious equestrian
                     or country use.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The proceedings were issued in August 2019 against The House of Bruar Ltd (“Bruar”)
                     and two of its directors. The claim initially included an allegation of infringement
                     of two RCDs: the RCD for the Heeled Regina, and a design for a boot known as the Amira.
                     However, the Defendants admitted infringement of the Amira design in the Defence and
                     Counterclaim, and I do not need to deal further with that design, as such. The Claimants
                     nevertheless said that the admission that the Amira design had been copied showed
                     that the Defendants were willing or had a propensity to copy their designs. When the
                     proceedings were issued, complaint was made about two versions of the Defendants’
                     boots alleged to infringe the Heeled Regina design. A third boot design came to the
                     Claimants’ attention after issue, leading to an amendment to the Particulars of Claim
                     in September 2019 to add that boot.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Directions were given in an order dated 3 April 2020. The Order and the list of issues
                     did not limit the number of prior designs to be taken into account, which was a matter
                     of some significance because numerous earlier boot designs were pleaded by the Defendants
                     in order to challenge the validity or scope of the Claimants’ rights. At trial, Miss
                     Pickard helpfully identified a narrower range of designs which she said were the most
                     relevant.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the Claimants, both Mr Parker and Mr Fountaine provided witness statements and
                     were cross-examined. Mr Fountaine was a wholly credible and reliable witness, as the
                     Defendants accepted. However, they contended that Mr Parker was not a reliable witness,
                     saying that his explanation of the process of designing the Heeled Regina was incomplete
                     or confused, and that he gave various different dates when the design was said to
                     have been made. On the whole, I found Mr Parker to be a credible witness, who was
                     doing his best to explain the design process and I accept that he genuinely believed
                     that the various designs which he had made had different features. However, he was
                     rather unclear about the dates of the various designs, and especially as to the sequence
                     of various design changes in the critical period of October and November 2014. I did
                     not find his difficulty in specifying the relevant dates surprising so long after
                     the event, nor did it lead me to doubt his veracity, but I have concluded that I should
                     not rely upon Mr Parker’s recollections as to dates without some corroborative evidence.
                     The third witness for the Claimants was Mr Duff, a business consultant who sits on
                     the board of the First Claimant. His evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendants’ main witnesses were Mrs Lorna Meikle (née Macleod) and the Second
                     Defendant, Mr Patrick Birkbeck. Mrs Meikle is a long-standing employee of Bruar, and
                     has been its ladieswear buyer for around 15 years. Regrettably, I did not find Mrs
                     Meikle to be a reliable witness. For the reasons set out below, I did not believe
                     her evidence on a number of points, and in particular I did not accept her denial
                     that Bruar had copied the Heeled Regina design. I therefore consider it right to treat
                     all of her evidence with caution, save as consistent with any corroborative evidence.
                     I found Mr Birkbeck to be a more credible witness, although there were some gaps in
                     his evidence, for instance as to his explanation of the design process when ordering
                     the Defendants’ Version 3 boot, which differed as between his witness statement and
                     his oral evidence and as to the explanation he gave for the use of F&amp;F’s boots in
                     Bruar’s 2018/19 catalogue, given that the same ‘mistake’ had been made in the previous
                     year’s catalogue, something which he did not seek to explain. In addition, the Defendants
                     relied upon a witness statement of their solicitor, Mr Bevan, who exhibited various
                     documents, and who was not cross-examined. They also served a Civil Evidence notice
                     seeking to rely upon some correspondence between Mr Lazo and Mr Birkbeck.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Parker and Mr Fountaine were schoolfriends who at the age of 16 came up with the
                     idea of running their own luxury leather business. After going to agricultural college
                     Mr Parker spent some time working with his godfather’s business, Abarca, which provided
                     him with an introduction to the leather and footwear industries. By about 2012, aged
                     around 21, Mr Parker and Mr Fountaine started trading under the name "Fairfax &amp; Favor.”
                     They imported shoes from Spain and initially sold them through country shows and fairs
                     and it seems that they have had a good measure of success. They decided early on that
                     they wished to sell goods made to their own designs, with Mr Parker having the design
                     and aesthetic input, and Mr Fountaine looking after the business development and administration.
                     The First Claimant company (“F&amp;F”) was incorporated on 7 May 2013 and its turnover
                     has increased year on year; in the year to February 2017 its turnover was just over
                     £3 million, rising to £13.5 million pounds for the 10 months to December 2020. F&amp;F
                     has 42 employees and sells directly through its own website and at events and shows
                     such as Badminton and Burley, as well as through a number of retailers.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The First Defendant, House of Bruar Ltd, (“Bruar”) was described by Mrs Meikle as
                     a major independent country fashion retailer based in Perthshire in Scotland. It sells
                     traditional tweed and cashmere garments and other clothing and footwear with a rural
                     or country theme, as well as sporting accessories, outdoor equipment, home and kitchenware
                     and Scottish food and drink. It deals in well-known fashion brands as well as products
                     sourced directly from "high-quality artisan producers." The business has an annual
                     turnover of around £30 million and sells from retail premises in Perthshire as well
                     as via an online and mail order catalogue. Mrs Meikle explained that footwear accounted
                     for less than 20% of the ladies' clothing and accessories for which she is responsible,
                     but she did not give any turnover figures for footwear. It is clear that by at least
                     early 2016 Ms Meikle and Bruar were aware of F&amp;F and its products.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Claimants’ case (as clarified in its Amended Reply) was that the Heeled Regina
                     boot was designed by Mr Parker, who is an employee as well as a director of F&amp;F. He
                     was not a professional designer, but through working at Abarca had experience of the
                     footwear trade including trade in Spanish shoes and boots. This had, in particular,
                     introduced him to manufacturers in the town of Valverde del Camino, which appears
                     to be a centre of footwear production. There was some contradictory evidence before
                     me as to who had designed some Spanish riding boots made in Valverde, which were popularised
                     by Miss Kate Middleton, the future Duchess of Cambridge, but this was not directly
                     relevant to the matters which I have to decide.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Parker had met Mr Lazo of Lazo y Duque, which is a Valverde manufacturer, whilst
                     he was working for Abarca, and it was Lazo &amp; Duque which produced the prototypes of
                     the Heeled Regina boot. Mr Parker’s evidence was that he wanted to produce a style
                     of boot which was more stylish and elegant, and less rugged, than a boot truly designed
                     for riding. Whilst working for Abarca he had designed a form of riding boot which
                     the Defendants relied upon in these proceedings as relevant prior art (“the Abarca
                     boot”). Then, in around 2013 he designed a boot for F&amp;F which was identified as the
                     “Early Regina.” The Defendants’ case was that the Early Regina was the same as the
                     Abarca boot. It had many of the same features as the RCD but had a flat heel and did
                     not have a rear elasticated panel like the Heeled Regina. The Early Regina was made
                     for the Claimants by Lazo &amp; Duque and was given reference number 1752 by Mr Lazo.
                     It appears to have been offered for sale from at least July 2013.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Parker said that he subsequently came up with the concept of the Heeled Regina
                     boot, and asked Mr Lazo to make up samples of the design for F&amp;F to consider.  The
                     design process appears to have proceeded in two steps, initially by the production
                     of an intervening design, the “1856.” Mr Parker sent a series of emails to Mr Lazo
                     in mid-October 2014 giving him details of the features of the proposed design. He
                     sent Mr Lazo a photograph of the Early Regina, together with a photograph of a shoe
                     which had the kind of mid-height heel he wanted to use for the boot. A single sample
                     was made of that boot, to which Mr Lazo gave his reference number 1856 (this number
                     may be out of sequence, as later designs have lower numbers, but no point was taken
                     about this). It was never sold, although photographs of it were posted on F&amp;F’s social
                     media on 26 November 2014, stating “Who is loving our new Regina heeled boot?” The
                     1856 was one of the prior designs relied upon by the Defendants:

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The email exchanges show that in about mid-October 2014 Mr Parker asked Mr Lazo to
                     add an elasticated panel or gusset, overlaid with strips of leather/suede, running
                     down the back of the heeled boot, as well as adding the existing type of F&amp;F tassels.
                     By an email dated 15 October 2014, Mr Lazo asked for details of the kind of elastic
                     panel that was wanted, saying that they were making the sample. Mr Parker immediately
                     sent him a photograph showing the kind of panel he wanted, which had 4 parallel leather
                     strips with zigzag edges covering the length of the elastic base.  Later the same
                     day Mr Lazo told Mr Parker that the elastic sample was being made and would be ready
                     the following week. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Parker’s evidence was that in November 2014 he visited Mr Lazo and they finalised
                     the design, which involved making a number of small changes arising from the addition
                     of the higher heel, and varied the design of the suede strips over the panel by removing
                     the zigzag edges. In another set of emails dated 27 November 2014, Mr Lazo and Mr
                     Parker discussed the price of the boots, which by then had been given reference number
                     1857 (later they seem also to have been given number 1858). Mr Lazo said that they
                     were going to make patterns and batches of the boots, which Mr Parker wanted for early
                     January. Moreover, Mr Lazo confirmed on 27 November 2014 that the various designs
                     were exclusive to F&amp;F. At some point the flat-heeled Early Regina was also produced
                     with the same elastic panel, and this model was given number 1852.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Lazo &amp; Duque manufactured the Heeled Regina boots until about April 2017. In 2018,
                     the Claimants became concerned that Lazo &amp; Duque were supplying copies of their boots
                     to unauthorised third parties (not the Defendants), leading them to seek and obtain
                     an undertaking from Lazo &amp; Duque not to do so. Lazo &amp; Duque confirmed that the design
                     of the gusset had been made by Mr Parker and the Heeled Regina was exclusive to F&amp;F.

                     the top of the boot, and the decorative features – the fan and tassel. The Partial

                     to try to sell their products to retailers with established client bases. One such
                     agent, a Mr Pound, began discussions with Bruar in about 2015, offering to supply
                     them with boots. That, and similar exchanges in 2016, did not lead to sales, as Bruar
                     objected to the price of the boots. In early January 2016, Mr Pound sent Mrs Meikle
                     an F&amp;F brochure which (she accepted) would by then have included the Heeled Regina
                     boot, as F&amp;F’s most popular product.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In early 2017, according to Mrs Meikle, she met another company based in Valverde,
                     Dakota Boots (“Dakota”), which was run by a Mr Arroyo. She said that Bruar had previously
                     bought other goods from Dakota. Her evidence was that she ordered samples and stock
                     of Dakota’s existing “Model 94” boot at the MICAM trade show. She said that Model
                     94 was the earliest of the Defendants’ boots in issue in these proceedings (the “Version
                     1” boot). It was said by the Claimants to include all of the identified elements of
                     the Heeled Regina design, including the long 4 strips of leather over the elasticated
                     rear panel. However, there was no evidence that the model existed in that form prior
                     to Mrs Meikle meeting with Mr Arroyo, whilst he referred to the boots as “NEW model
                     reference 94” in an email dated 19 July 2017.

                     delay, and Dakota invoiced for them in June 2017, but Mrs Meikle said that Bruar was
                     let down by Dakota and did not receive stocks of the Version 1 boots in 2017. Emails
                     passing between her and Mr Arroyo show her chasing for the boots in August 2017. However,
                     despite his unreliability, more Version 1 boots were ordered in 2018. Again, Bruar
                     chased Dakota for samples and stock, and Dakota failed to deliver.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At some point in about May 2017 a photoshoot took place for Bruar’s 2017/18 catalogue,
                     which was due for release in August. I was provided with a copy of the catalogue,
                     which includes a photograph showing one tan and one brown boot, and another photograph
                     of a highly similar but not identical brown boot. It was the Claimants’ case that
                     the tan coloured boot and one of the brown boots were F&amp;F boots, whilst the second
                     brown boot was a copy of the Heeled Regina, one of the Defendants’ Version 1 boots.
                     The Defendants did not dispute that some of the photographs showed F&amp;F boots rather
                     than samples received from Dakota<i>. </i>The Claimants suggested that the tan F&amp;F boot shown in the catalogue was the one bought

                     boot came to feature in the catalogue. It seems highly likely to me that it was indeed
                     a photograph of the boot she had bought, and that the brown F&amp;F boot ordered on 29
                     May by Mr Whitfield was also included in the catalogue, although Mrs Meikle and Mr
                     Birkbeck said that they did not know anything about it.<i> </i>The Version 1 boots looked like this:

                     but before they did so they were contacted by Mrs Meikle by email dated 25 September
                     2017. Shortly afterwards she agreed to place some quite modest orders for a variety
                     of F&amp;F’s designs, which included the Regina and Amira boots, at what Mr Fountaine
                     described as a special price.  She accepted that at that stage Bruar knew that the
                     boots in its catalogue were not available from Dakota. I am satisfied that Bruar ordered
                     the boots from F&amp;F because it was in need of goods to supply to its customers which
                     looked like those in its catalogue, although this too was denied by Mrs Meikle.

                     would stop it selling the Version 1 boots, which they saw as infringing their rights,
                     and so they did not write a letter of claim to them at that stage.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the event, unfortunately, the commercial relationship between the parties was short-lived.
                     Mrs Meikle said that Bruar was keen to sell the F&amp;F boots because they were being
                     asked for them, she thought the range would fit well in Bruar’s catalogue and it would
                     be a good brand to have in the shop, but the problem was the price. However, that
                     is hard to square with the documentary evidence. In January 2018, Mrs Meikle wrote
                     to Mr Arroyo to see whether he would be able to supply Bruar. She speculated that
                     the reason for the previous lack of supply was that “the people who do a very similar
                     boot to the one we asked you for” (which must have been a reference to F&amp;F) might
                     have contacted him and asked him not to supply them. Then Bruar re-ordered some Version
                     1 boots from Dakota in March 2018, after the MICAM trade show, and asked Dakota to
                     provide samples. In April 2018 Mrs Meikle wrote to Mr Fountaine expressing some embarrassment,
                     but saying that the price of F&amp;F’s boots was not acceptable to the Defendants. She
                     asked whether it was possible to move to a 10% discount and reiterated that unless
                     the 10% discount was possible there was no point wasting his time with a conversation.
                     Mr Fountaine said again that he would be happy to discuss the matter with her. However,
                     she did not revert to him, no further negotiations took place, and no further orders
                     were placed with F&amp;F. Mrs Meikle denied that Bruar’s decision to stop selling F&amp;F’s
                     boots was connected with ordering the Version 1 boots from Dakota but, in the circumstances,
                     it seems to me that the reason for ceasing to take supplies from F&amp;F was not related
                     to pricing but was, as the Claimants suggested, linked to Bruar’s belief that equivalent
                     boots would be supplied by Dakota.

                     for use in the catalogue of both the Model 94 boots and some boots described as a
                     “new development” of an “over the knee” boot. She said she would send a sample of
                     the latter boot, which Bruar needed Mr Arroyo to “copy exactly.” She sent him a link
                     to a page on F&amp;F’s website showing the Amira boot. Not surprisingly, she accepted
                     in evidence that Bruar’s objective in so doing was for Dakota to make exact copies
                     of the Amira boot, which it appears to have done. That infringement was admitted.

                     was that using the F&amp;F boots in the catalogue when those boots were no longer in stock
                     was a mistake. However, I formed the view that those photographs were included deliberately,
                     as a matter of expediency, as they had been in 2017, because of Dakota’s shortcomings
                     in supplying samples of the Version 1 boots.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Seeing the 2018/19 brochure led the Claimants to send a letter of claim to Bruar about
                     the Version 1 boots on 28 August 2018. This apparently led directly to the development
                     of Bruar’s Version 2 boots, which Bruar hoped would put an end to the Claimants’ complaints.
                     I was told that the redesign was discussed at a meeting between Mr Birkbeck and Mr
                     Arroyo in September 2018. Mr Birkbeck accepted that the Version 2 design was a modification
                     of the Version 1 boots. It is unclear to me whether that timing is correct, or whether,
                     as Mr Parker speculated, the Version 2 boots had been designed earlier in 2018, but
                     it matters not. Mr Birkbeck said that a number of changes to the Version 1 design
                     were discussed, but not implemented, and the end result was that Version 2 was the
                     same as Version 1 save that it has only 2 suede strips over the elasticated panel
                     at the back of the boot. In fact, the Version 2 boot shown to me had two small additional
                     changes: it did not include the piping around the top of the boot present in Version
                     1, and the colour of the lining had been changed from an ochre colour to orange (whilst
                     the colour forms no part of the claim, I understand that F&amp;F’s boots are lined in
                     orange).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In October 2018, in response to the letter of claim, Bruar said that it had only sold
                     the samples of the Version 1 boots, but was going to produce a replacement product,
                     and “take further steps to differentiate” it from the Heeled Regina. Mr Birkbeck and Mrs Meikle gave evidence that in March 2019 they visited a number
                     of manufacturers in Valverde to source a substitute for the Version 2 boot. Whether
                     or not by coincidence, they visited Lazo &amp; Duque. Mr Birkbeck said that it was only
                     when they met Mr Lazo that they realised that Lazo &amp; Duque had made the Heeled Regina
                     boot for F&amp;F, and Bruar chose them to make the Version 3 boot.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Birkbeck said that they based the Version 3 boot on existing Lazo &amp; Duque designs,
                     rather than on the Heeled Regina. Certainly, in an email of 24 April 2019 to Mr Lazo
                     discussing the new design Mr Birkbeck referred to two design numbers: number 1727
                     which is one of the earlier designs relied upon by the Defendants, and number 1969,
                     which was not in evidence. However, Mr Birkbeck accepted in cross-examination that
                     the Heeled Regina was “absolutely” in his “thought patterns” when ordering the Version
                     3 boots from Lazo &amp; Duque. No doubt that explains why the Version 3 boots have a gusset
                     with full length suede panels over it, identical in concept though not in placement
                     to the Heeled Regina. The gusset is located on the inside of the boot, and the vertical
                     leather strips are adjacent to the centre side seam, and separated by a wider roughly
                     triangular panel from the back seam. The front of the boots is made in a single piece,
                     like the Heeled Regina, rather than like the split front of the Version 1 and 2 boots.
                     The tassel is rather longer than on the Defendants’ earlier boots:

                           In <i>Neptune [2018] F.S.R. 3 </i>, Henry Carr J said (at [59] and [60]):

                                 time of creation of the designs’, per Jacob LJ in <i>Lambretta Clothing Co Ltd v Teddy Smith (UK) Ltd [2004] EWCA Civ 886; [2005] R.P.C.

                                 the shape of a design at a higher level of abstraction than its physical manifestation
                                 in the relevant article. As explained by Arnold J in the <i>Whitby </i>case at [45], this makes it harder for the claimant to prove infringement, and also
                                 makes it harder for the defendant to prove that the design is commonplace. Nonetheless,
                                 the commonplace exclusion remains a useful crosscheck on the breadth of a claim to
                                 infringement—the more generalised the definition of the design relied upon, the more
                                 likely it is to encompass designs which would ‘excite no peculiar attention in those
                                 in the relevant art’.”

                     boot) in October 2014 and the Heeled Regina was also created that month. It is clear
                     from Mr Parker’s evidence, from the emails exchanged with Mr Lazo, and from F&amp;F’s
                     Instagram account that the 1856 design was made earlier than the Heeled Regina design,
                     at some time between mid-October and 26 November 2014.<i> </i>I do not think that the timing of the creation of the Partial designs was contentious.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendants disputed the claim that the Heeled Regina design also dated back to
                     October 2014. It seems to me that the history of the creation of the Heeled Regina
                     set out above shows that whilst Mr Parker may have had a fairly detailed idea in mind
                     about that design in October, some of the design work, including the important detailing
                     of the gusset, was not finalised until he met Mr Lazo in November 2014. The exchanges
                     on 27 November 2014 show that prior to that date Mr Lazo had identified the design,
                     attributed a design number to it, and accepted that it had been made exclusively for
                     F&amp;F.  There was no suggestion that the design was recorded in a design document, and
                     the evidence did not clearly establish when the first sample of the Heeled Regina
                     was made. However, by 27 November Mr Lazo was ready to make patterns and batches of
                     the Heeled Regina, and so, on the balance of probabilities<i>, </i>it seems to me that a sample would have been made before that date, most likely when
                     Mr Parker visited the factory earlier in November 2014. I reject the Claimants’ submission
                     that the design was complete in October 2014, whether or not recorded in a document
                     or sample. I conclude that the subsistence of UKUDR in the Partial designs needs to
                     be tested as at October 2014, and in the Heeled Regina design as at November 2014
                     (and prior to 27 November).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendants concentrated their attack on the subsistence of the UKUDR upon the
                     issue of whether the designs were commonplace in the sense explained above. They pleaded
                     numerous earlier boot designs in support of their contention that the Heeled Regina
                     design and the Partial designs were commonplace, and consisted of a combination of
                     commonplace features. I was provided with pictures of the earlier boots, of varying
                     degrees of clarity, but there was no direct evidence from anyone familiar with those
                     designs, other than from Mr Parker who was familiar with some of the boots.  The Defendants
                     restricted their arguments at trial to 5 earlier designs. Those, and many of the other
                     designs pleaded, share a number of features with the F&amp;F designs in issue, such as
                     a tassel hanging from the zip pull and a perforated or decorated fan shape at the
                     top of the boot, which I gather are typical features of a Spanish riding boot. However,
                     the Defendants did not contend that any of the earlier boots had all of the features
                     of the Heeled Regina. I shall consider the five boots in what I believe to be their
                     chronological order.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The first of the boots relied upon was style 1620, a knee-length Spanish riding boot
                     shown in the Lazo &amp; Duque 2010 catalogue. Whilst it had the fan detail and a tassel,
                     and an angled if not curved zip, it had a flat heel and a heavy sole, and looked rugged
                     and utilitarian. Mr Parker commented upon the narrower leg of his designs, and I consider
                     that the 1620 looked markedly wider around the ankle than the Heeled Regina and the
                     Partial designs, as well as being much heavier overall. The Defendants relied upon
                     the 1620 in particular for some elastication at the back of the boot which is just
                     visible in the catalogue. However, what one can see is a crinkled or gathered panel
                     on the back half of the outside of the boot; it is not clear whether it extended around
                     the whole of the back of the boot, or just to the centre back, nor is it clear whether
                     the panel was made of or covered in leather. The 1620 may (I cannot be sure) have
                     had the same concept as the Heeled Regina of elastication along the full height of
                     the boot, at the rear of the boot, but this took a very different form and looked
                     very different to the elasticated panel of the Heeled Regina.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Next in time was the “Central Hipica” boot. This was again very different to the designs
                     in issue, in being a flat heeled, thick-soled, heavy and utilitarian looking boot.
                     The Defendants relied upon it because it too had an elasticated panel, probably, although
                     not definitely, with thin strips of leather attached to it. However, it seems from
                     the photographs in evidence that the panel was just on the outer side of the boot,
                     rather than at the centre back of the boot. It did not extend to the full height of
                     the boot, but only to around mid-calf level, and had a curved edge.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Next, the Defendants relied on another Lazo y Duque boot from 2013 called the “Bota
                     Kate.” This had a slightly slimmer profile than the 1620, and a slightly higher heel,
                     but I would again describe it as a low-heeled boot. Its sole looked thicker than the
                     Regina designs, though much less rugged than the sole of the 1620. It seems to me
                     that the photograph in evidence may show stitching running down the centre of the
                     front of the boot, but this may be a fault in the reproduction of the image. Certainly,
                     the evidence showed no sign of any elastic panel, at the back or otherwise.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Some way into the proceedings, the Defendants learned of a boot which was referred
                     to as the Cejudo boot, made by another artisan from Valverde, Manuel Cejudo. He claims
                     (rightly or wrongly, as Mr Lazo also appears to have made this claim) to be the maker
                     of the Spanish riding boots sold to the Duchess of Cambridge. The Defendants produced
                     some pages from the Cejudo website from February 2014, showing thumbnails of a range
                     of boots and other leather goods for sale. As the Claimants pointed out, the website
                     appears to show that Mr Cejudo will make boots to order, combining features shown
                     on the site. The Defendants amended the Defence to rely upon this boot:

                     Cejudo in around 2011. The video was of poor quality, and I am not convinced that
                     the boot shown in it, which Mrs Meikle said appeared to have an elasticated gusset
                     at the back, was the boot above, as it seems to me to have a lower heel. Nor was the
                     nature of the gusset (if any) at all clear. The photograph above is the only clear
                     picture of this boot.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Claimants pointed to various differences between the Cejudo boot and the Heeled
                     Regina which are clear from the photograph above, such as the straight zip and the
                     buckle across the top of the boot, but perhaps most importantly, the lack of any sign
                     of an elasticated gusset at the back of the boot. It is not possible to see any form
                     of elastication at the back of the boot. Mr St Quintin suggested that the Cejudo boot
                     did not have a sloping top like the Claimants’ designs, which may be right, it is
                     hard to be sure. There are also double lines of stitching around the heel piece and
                     full length vertical strips of leather on each side of the zip which in my view are
                     quite prominent.

                     because it was obscure. <span style="color:#000000">The evidential burden rests on the Defendants to </span>show that it is not, whilst finding an obscure example which is fairly similar to
                     the Claimants’ design may not be enough to make the design commonplace. Here, the Defendants only discovered the Cejudo boot after a lengthy and thorough
                     research process undertaken by their solicitors. Their solicitor, Mr Bevan, made a
                     witness statement in March 2021 in support of an application to amend the Defence
                     to plead two earlier designs, the Abarca boot and the Cejudo boot. He explained that

                           boot did not come to light. It was only just before exchange of witness statements
                           in February 2021, when Mr Bevan was looking for a document to exhibit to Mrs Meikle’s
                           witness statement to give an introduction to Valverde, that he found an article (from
                           Die Welt, in German) which mentioned Mr Cejudo, which led Mr Bevan to find the website
                           page showing the boot relied upon. Mrs Meikle, who said that she was familiar with
                           Valverde and its artisan producers, plainly knew nothing about Cejudo. Mr Parker,
                           who had visited Valverde on a number of occasions, also said that he had never heard
                           of Mr Cejudo.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have considered carefully whether it suffices that the Cejudo design was shown amongst
                     other designs on the Manuel Cejudo website. However, in my judgment the fact that
                     neither the Cejudo website nor the particular boot relied upon came to the Defendants'
                     notice whilst carrying out their extensive research prior to filing the Defence, supports
                     the conclusion that the Cejudo boot design was obscure. That view is reinforced by
                     the fact that neither Mrs Meikle nor Mr Parker, both of whom were very familiar with
                     Valverde and its manufacturers, knew of Mr Cejudo, let alone that boot. In my judgment,
                     the Defendants have not shown that this boot might have been ‘current in the thinking
                     of designers in the field at the time of creation of the designs.’ In the circumstances,
                     in my judgment it is not to be taken into account as prior art for the unregistered
                     designs. If I am wrong about that point, the fact that it had no elastication means that it
                     would not affect the findings below as to the validity of the Heeled Regina design.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Lastly, the Defendants relied upon the 1856 boot. As may be seen from the photographs
                     above, this had many of the same features as the Heeled Regina, save for the gusset
                     at the back. It was developed from the Early Regina and, as I have explained above,
                     was the forebear of the Heeled Regina. The Defendants said that the Early Regina was
                     the same as the Abarca boot, and some of the photographs of <i>that</i> boot show that, when worn, it is loose fitting, and creases or wrinkles around the
                     ankle.  Mr Parker said that both the 1856 and the Abarca were wider boots than the
                     Early Regina or Heeled Regina. It is not easy to resolve that dispute from the photographs
                     in evidence, but on balance it does seem to me that the Abarca boot looked wider than
                     the Early Regina but the 1856 had the same or much the same profile as the Early Regina
                     (in its non-elasticated form). The emails in which Mr Parker asked Mr Lazo to make
                     the 1856 do not refer to slimming the shaft of the boot, only to the sole and heel.
                     However, the Heeled Regina appears to me to have a slimmer profile than the 1856,
                     facilitated by the elasticated panel. In the circumstances, I accept Mr  Parker’s
                     evidence that the 1856 was a wider boot than the Heeled Regina.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The panelled gusset has a significant impact on the overall design of the Heeled Regina,
                     not simply because it slims the boot, but because the panels run all the way from
                     the heel piece up to the top of the boot. In contrast, the narrow strip of leather
                     over the centre seam on the back of the 1865 boot runs only from the heel piece to
                     the cuff which encircles the whole of the top of the boot. Mr Parker suggested that
                     the new feature tended to elongate the appearance of the boot, and I accept that it
                     does so.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendants said that the Heeled Regina design was commonplace and, as the 1856
                     had all of the features of the RCD save for the back panel, it was in effect the Partial
                     design shown at paragraph 16 above. The latter point was accepted by the Claimants
                     in their Amended Reply and Defence to Counterclaim. The 1856 was never sold, probably
                     because it was overtaken by the full Heeled Regina design, but, as I have said, photographs
                     of it were posted on F&amp;F’s social media on 26 November 2014.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">None of the prior art comprises a boot with an elasticated panel covered by thin strips
                     of leather running the full height of the boot. Indeed, none of the boots I saw in
                     the evidence appear to have had a panel/gusset even vaguely similar to that included
                     in the Heeled Regina. The Defendants relied upon the elastication at the rear of the
                     1620 and (rear) side of the Central Hipica boots, but I am satisfied that such elastication
                     looked completely different to the panel used in the Heeled Regina.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I conclude that the elasticated panel with its leather strips designed by Mr Parker
                     was an original feature. Further, in my view, the panelled feature is of some visual significance to the overall design of the Heeled Regina, because it tends
                     to elongate the look of the boot from the rear, and the elastication facilitates the
                     narrower leg of the boot. In the circumstances, so far as the Heeled Regina is concerned, it seems to me that
                     it is not, as the Defendants contended, a design consisting simply of a combination
                     of run-of-the-mill features. Nothing resembling the panel feature has been shown to have existed in any other design
                     in the field in question, and I am satisfied that the Heeled Regina was not commonplace as at November 2014.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Whilst the 1856 boot formed part of the design corpus from 26 November 2014, I have
                     found that by then the design of the Heeled Regina had been completed. If I am wrong
                     on that, and the Heeled Regina design was made a little later (as the Defendants suggest),
                     in my view, the differences between the 1856 and the Heeled Regina designs are marked.
                     Relying on the 1856 does not help the Defendants as it did not include the panel feature
                     or anything like it, and I am satisfied that taking it into account would not render the Heeled Regina commonplace.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The position is different for the Partial designs.  First, the Defendants pleaded
                     that the Partial designs did not have sufficient originality in the copyright sense,
                     allegedly as slavish copies of the Early Regina and an existing heel design. I do
                     not accept that submission. In my view, the Partial designs are not simply a copies
                     of any previous design(s). Whilst they may have been closely based upon the Early
                     Regina, in my view, producing the design did require some design input in terms of
                     the choice of the heel and sole.  Applying the legal guidance which I have set out
                     above, I reject the suggestion that they lacked the necessary copyright originality.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As for the allegation that the Partial designs are commonplace, it is of course necessary
                     to consider them as a whole, not simply take a pick and mix approach to their features
                     and compare them to individual features of earlier designs. Not all combinations of
                     known features produce a commonplace design. As pointed out in <i>Copinger &amp; Skone James on Copyright</i> (at 13-120) where the goods are fashion items “often it is the particular arrangement
                     of features that creates an aesthetic effect which, if new, takes the design above
                     the commonplace.” Certainly, the Partial designs share a number of features with several of the earlier
                     designs in evidence, but it is notable that the Spanish riding boots in evidence tend
                     to have a flat or low heel, and in many cases a rugged, utilitarian sole. Apart from
                     the Early Regina, the Bota Kate was perhaps the closest overall, with a heel that
                     was low rather than flat, and a medium sole. If the Cejudo boot should (contrary to
                     my finding above) also have been taken into account, I do not consider that it advances
                     the Defendants’ arguments. It has a heel of much the same height as the Partial designs,
                     but the zips are noticeably different, the sole looks thicker, the boot looks ‘clompier’
                     and the Partial designs lack the prominent buckle on the Cejudo.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The 1856 was described by F&amp;F as “the new Regina” and the instructions given to Mr
                     Lazo asked him to amend the Early Regina design, which had a flat heel. Raising the
                     heel height and changing the sole of the boot to create the 1856 boot required, it
                     seems, relatively simple changes, substituting well-known and commonplace components
                     for the heel and sole of F&amp;F’s existing boot, in contrast to the work done to produce
                     the Heeled Regina design. There was no evidence that the profile of the boot was also
                     changed at that point. I have considered carefully whether the new combination of
                     features shown in the 1856 boot did produce a new aesthetic effect, and I have concluded
                     that it did not do so. I do not consider that the 1856 would have excited any particular
                     attention amongst those in the design field. I find that the Partial designs consisted
                     of a relatively simple combination of well-known features, and the combination was
                     commonplace. Design right does not subsist in the Partial designs.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to ownership of the designs, the Defendants alleged that Mr Parker was not, in reality, the designer of the Heeled Regina, but it was
                     designed by Mr Lazo as the artisan producer; this was put on the basis that Mr Lazo
                     had designed the 1727 boots, and then simply modified them. In my judgment, Mr Parker’s
                     input to the creation of the Heeled Regina design was not that of a customer asking
                     for some bespoke alterations to an existing design, but was sufficient that he was
                     the designer. Mr Lazo was the skilled craftsman who followed Mr Parker’s instructions
                     to create samples to the design. Not only do I consider that Mr Parker was the designer, but Mr Lazo acknowledged that
                     to be the case, for instance in a letter which he wrote to F&amp;F’s solicitors in July
                     2018. It is therefore unnecessary for me to deal with the alternative scenario put forward
                     by the Claimants, that Lazo &amp; Duque had granted F&amp;F an exclusive licence to use the
                     design.

                     its Model 94, but there was no evidence to support that claim, and a good deal of

                     given the close similarity of the two designs. The very fact that for two consecutive
                     years Bruar used photographs of the Heeled Regina boots in its catalogues to advertise
                     its own boots speaks to the similarity between them – Bruar appears to have thought
                     they were interchangeable or indistinguishable at least to its customers.

                     documents suggest that they were not. For instance, in an email from Mr Arroyo to
                     Mrs Meikle of 13 April 2018 he assured her that Dakota would deliver “the 2 models
                     of Fairfax middle next week”, and there were references in various further emails
                     passing between Mrs Meikle and Dakota to phrases such as “the two Fairfax boots” or
                     “the other Fairfax boot.”  It seems that Dakota’s price for the Amira copies was too
                     high for Bruar, and in an email to Mr Arroyo in June 2018, Mrs Meikle complained “I
                     need a price for the new Fairfax over the knee … this is very, very expensive. The
                     <i>other Fairfax boot</i> is only [<i>  </i>] euro so [<i>  </i>] euro cannot be right.” (emphasis added). In cross-examination, accepting that this
                     was a reference to the Version 1 boot, she said that she would have referred to it
                     in this way because Bruar had been wanting a competitive boot to the Heeled Regina.
                     Again, I found that response incredible. The correspondence appears to me undoubtedly
                     to refer to the Model 94 boot as a “Fairfax boot” in just the same way as the over
                     the knee boots were (copy) Fairfax boots, that is to say, Version 1 was a copy of
                     the Heeled Regina.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In all the circumstances, I conclude that Bruar wished to sell boots which looked
                     like F&amp;F’s boots, and asked Dakota to copy the Heeled Regina design when making the
                     Version 1 and Version 2 boots. In my judgment, the denial of copying is incompatible
                     with the documentary evidence.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Birkbeck accepted that the 2018/19 catalogue had included F&amp;F boots, and said that he was annoyed that the F&amp;F boots, which were by then old stock so far as Bruar was
                     concerned, had been included in the catalogue by mistake. He gave no real explanation
                     of why the same thing had occurred in the previous year’s catalogue. In the light
                     of Mrs Meikle’s email exchanges with Dakota, it seems to me that at least until June
                     2018 Bruar intended to sell the Version 1 boots, as well as the copies of the Amira
                     boots. In the circumstances, the inclusion of the genuine Heeled Regina boots as well as its Version 1 boots in that year’s catalogue was probably
                     done because of the continuing delay in receiving samples from Dakota, rather than
                     just by mistake, either with the intention of supplying genuine F&amp;F boots or (much
                     more probably) because Bruar thought that it could advertise its boots by showing
                     the F&amp;F boots, and then supply its own boots.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is less clear that the Version 3 boot was deliberately copied from the Heeled Regina.
                     Mr Birkbeck’s email to Mr Lazo of 24 April 2019 did refer to two earlier design numbers,
                     1727 and 1969, which he said were combined to produce Version 3.  1727 was a flat
                     boot with no elastication,  a thick sole and a wider profile, which lacks many of
                     the pleaded features of the Heeled Regina, and there is no explanation of how the
                     heel/sole and shape of Version 3 were changed from the 1727 to look like that of the
                     Heeled Regina. I was not shown the 1969 design, so assume that it is not relevant.
                     When asked about this, all Mr Birkbeck said was that he had not ‘presented’ the Heeled
                     Regina or the Version 1 or 2 boots to Mr Lazo. That does not strike me as a very complete
                     answer. He would hardly have needed to present the Heeled Regina design to Mr Lazo. On balance,
                     I am satisfied that Bruar and Mr Lazo took the Heeled Regina design as their starting
                     point, rather than any other Lazo &amp; Duque product, and amended it in the hope of avoiding
                     any infringement. As Mr Birkbeck accepted, it was “absolutely” in their “thought patterns,” and this explains the similarity of the
                     heel and sole to those of the Heeled Regina, and the extension of the length of the tassel far beyond that of style 1727, or Versions
                     1 and 2, to be much closer to the Heeled Regina.  I find on balance that this version too was copied from the Heeled Regina, even if
                     it differs from it in the ways discussed below.

                     inspection, one can discern some minor differences: there is narrow piping around
                     the top of the boot, and the vamp or front of the boot is made in two pieces, not
                     one. In my judgment, those differences do not affect the result. I find that the design
                     was copied, and the Version 1 boots are made<span style="color:#000000"> very substantially to the Heeled Regina design.</span></p>

                     but the main change was to reduce the number of leather panels over the elastic gusset
                     from four to two. In my view this has a relatively limited impact, and in my judgment
                     the boots are still extremely similar to the Heeled Regina design. I find that the
                     Version 2 boots are made<span style="color:#000000"> substantially to the Heeled Regina design.</span></p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems that the Defendants hoped to avoid infringement by the changes made to the
                     Version 3 boot. Strangely, given that aim, the boot is more like the Heeled Regina
                     in having a single piece of leather at the front, and no piping, as well as the longer
                     tassel. And the elasticated panel in Version 3 has four vertical strips of leather
                     covering it, instead of the two strips of the Version 2 boot. However, in my judgment
                     the change to the placement of the elasticated panel takes a significant step away
                     from the Heeled Regina. The back of the boot looks very different to the Heeled Regina,
                     as it has a single strip of leather over the centre back seam (more like the 1856
                     boot). There is also a noticeable difference on the inside of the boot, where four
                     vertical strips of leather run the full height of the boot and abut the centre side
                     seam, with a wider roughly triangular panel between the strips and the centre back
                     seam. The difference to the elasticated panel of the Heeled Regina was evident on
                     inspection of the boots. In those circumstances, I find that the Version 3 boots were
                     not made exactly or substantially to the design of the Heeled Regina.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The next issue is whether the RCD is valid. There are, as HHJ Hacon stated in <i>Cantel </i>(above) 4 points to consider. First, the design sector. It was common ground that
                     this was to be tested in light of the field of ladies’ boots. Second is the identity
                     of the informed user and the degree of their awareness of the prior art. Again, it
                     was common ground that this was a buyer and/or wearer of such boots. Whilst Mr St
                     Quintin suggested that such an informed user might include a retailer, he was happy
                     to accept that the level of attention which would be paid to the goods would be that
                     of a consumer. Thirdly, I must assess the designer's degree of freedom in developing his&nbsp;design, focusing upon elements
                     in respect of which the designer had more design freedom<i>. </i>And lastly, I must compare the RCD with the earlier designs relied upon.

                     the Heeled Regina. There are innumerable possible permutations of ladies’ boot designs.
                     It is clear from the evidence before me that there are large numbers of designs for
                     ladies’ boots which exhibit a host of different features and combinations of features.
                     Indeed, evidence such as the Lazo y Duque catalogue of 2010 shows many forms of Spanish
                     riding boots, which suggests that even in that sub-category of the appropriate sector
                     here, there is design freedom.

                     if not curved zip, but it too had a flat heel. The design overall had a utilitarian
                     look, with a substantial sole, though one which was possibly rather less heavy and
                     rugged than the sole of the 1620. The boot had a relatively wide ankle and no visible

                     boot, as I have said, this also differed from the RCD, especially in the lack of any
                     panel at the back of the boot, and in the addition of stitching and the buckle. The

                     boot in the RCD as indicating strips of the same material as the boot (leather or
                     suede, etc) and many informed users would understand that they indicate the presence
                     of an elasticated panel or gusset. This distinguishes the RCD from both the Cejudo
                     boot (if I am right that it is relevant) and the 1856 boot. None of the 5 earlier
                     designs has any such feature at the back of the boot, and i<span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">n my judgment, the unusual rear panel is the feature of the RCD which will most strike

                     strips or elasticated back panel (if so understood) is such that none of the earlier
                     boots would produce the same overall impression on an informed user as the RCD. I therefore conclude that the RCD

                     the elasticated panel are in my view of more significance, given the significance of the rear part of the
                     RCD design to its validity. I conclude that the Version 3 design produces a different overall impression to the RCD and so does
                     not infringe it.
