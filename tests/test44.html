                        The outcome was that parties made various concessions and retired to negotiate a possible

                        settled the appellant’s appeal against HMRC’s decisions issued on 14 February 2013.
                        Those decisions had been issued under Section 8 Social Security Contributions (Transfer
                        of Functions etc) Act 1999 (“Section 8 decisions”) regarding the earnings of each
                        of A Dugdale and A Roe in relation to the period 6 April 2011 to 5 April 2012. On
                        the same day, the appellant also emailed the Tribunal confirming the position.

                        to the Tribunal stating that the appeal had not been withdrawn and the appellant was
                        proceeding with the remainder of the appeal.  Furthermore, the appellant had notified
                        HMRC and the Tribunal that they intended to apply to the Tribunal for costs in respect
                        of the issues arising from the Section 8 decisions.

                        to progress this appeal. The parties entered further negotiations but it proved impossible
                        to agree Case Management Directions. They requested that the matter be decided on
                        the available papers including the various versions of draft directions with tracked

                        where there has been compliance with Directions.

                              clear it can be, is a matter for the discretion of the FTT in that case. Any such
                              direction is made under rule 5 of FTT Rules which provides that the FTT may, among
                              other things, make directions in relation to the conduct of proceedings and the provision
                              of information and documents. The use of the word “may” in Rule 5 means that it is
                              also a matter of judicial discretion whether to make such directions. The power of
                              the FTT to make directions under rule 5 of the FTT Rules is a case management power
                              which must be exercised in accordance with the overriding objective in rule 2 of the
