On the balance of probability, the screenshots must have been part of the claim process since the claim had to be submitted online. We accept the assertion in the review conclusion letter that there had been no technical issues at the time the claims were made. It is difficult to see how the claims could have been made without being on the Declaration page since the virtual “button” to submit is on that page.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_49"><span class="judgment-body__number">49.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Frankly, in any event, we take the view that the screenshots are almost entirely irrelevant in deciding an appeal against an assessment. They might be relevant in the context of penalties but we are not dealing with that here. Our only issue is whether the assessment was timeously and properly made and, if so, whether it is in the correct sum.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_50"><span class="judgment-body__number">50.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The simple fact is that it is not disputed that the appellant was not self-employed when he applied for these grants. These grants were only available to the self-employed. He was never eligible for them. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_51"><span class="judgment-body__number">51.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"> Dr Milton had, what we consider to be, a bizarre argument which is articulated at paragraph 14 of his Skeleton Argument as “The appellant carried on the same trade in all the tax years mentioned in 4.2 a-d” and, at paragraph 20, as “The appellant was an individual and carried on the same trade throughout the relevant period.”</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_52"><span class="judgment-body__number">52.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Shortly put, although the appellant has always been an individual, the appellant certainly did not carry on the trade as an individual after 31 July 2018. Undoubtedly, at all relevant times, he was a fitness coach but that trade was conducted until 31 July 2018 by him as a sole trader and thereafter by his company. Those are two completely separate and different legal persons. As a sole trader he paid income tax. The company pays corporation tax. PAYE is deducted from the appellant’s earnings from the company but it is not his trade. It is his employment.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_53"><span class="judgment-body__number">53.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Furthermore “trade” is defined for the purposes of SEISS as I have recorded in paragraph 36 above.

In plain English, when Officer Sole confirmed that the appellant was not self-employed and did not carry on a trade for income tax purposes after 31 July 2018 but yet he had received SEISS he had the power to raise an assessment under paragraph 9 Schedule 16 FA 2020.
