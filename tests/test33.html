The court made her the subject of an interim care order when it approved the local authority’s interim care plan placing K and her mother is a residential unit where she and her mother would be assessed. Regrettably, following a serious incident in the placement, on 22 June 2022 it came to an abrupt end. The only available placement was an alternative residential placement where K and her mother reside to date. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_3"><span class="judgment-body__number">3.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 28 June 2022, the case returned to court and questions were raised about the suitability of the placement. On further investigation, it transpired that the placement is not a registered or regulated placement and the matter was subsequently allocated to me. The local authority concedes that it should have made the necessary enquiries prior to the mother and child being placed there. However, it argues that this was the only available placement which ensured that K was not separated from her mother. The local authority has continued its searches of regulated placements and there are no immediate options available.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_4"><span class="judgment-body__number">4.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Pending the identification of a regulated placement, the local authority has applied to invoke the court’s inherent jurisdiction by seeking the court’s approval and authorisation for the continuing placement of K and her mother. Latterly, the local authority had applied in the alternative for directions for assessment of K pursuant to s 38(6) of the Children Act (1989). As its case has crystalised, the local authority’s primary application is the latter of the two applications. The mother supports any mechanism through which her continuing care of K is assured and supports the local authority’s applications. The guardian and Cafcass resist the applications. It is submitted on behalf K that it is an inappropriate use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction or the statutory frame work to authorise an illegal placement where little is known about the suitability of the placement as a place of safety or as an assessment centre. It is further argued on behalf of K that this would be an inappropriate use of said provisions of the Act where the local authority has failed to demonstrate the unit’s capacity to appropriately undertake an assessment. Subsequently, the guardian has been able to visit the placement and following the provision of further information, her position has softened but continues to argue that it would be contrary to general policy that the court should sanction a placement in the face of the relevant statutory frame work that otherwise renders the placement illegal.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_5"><span class="judgment-body__number">5.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The local authority now makes identical applications in the second case which concerns R who is eight weeks old.

I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention – risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment – is surely unproblematic. So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of a forced marriage (as in Re KR and Re B) or so that she can be subjected to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war-zone. There is no need for me to go any further, so I need not consider whether there are other kinds of situation where a child who is already abroad should be made a ward of court or whether wardship is an appropriate remedy where the risk to the child is of harm falling short of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention. </span></i></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i><span style="color:#000000">33.&nbsp; In the Tower Hamlets case, Hayden J recognised (para 11) that the relief he was being asked to grant arose in circumstances without recent precedent, but rightly saw that as no obstacle.

To my mind the central focus of this aspect of the inherent jurisdiction is on the welfare and safety of children rather than on the potential commission of a criminal offence under section 11 of the Care Standards Act 2000 by others. Obviously, that central focus requires the court to give anxious and detailed consideration to the risks to the child in respect of a placement in which such an offence may be committed. However, the High Court is not required to determine whether an offence will be committed or whether the individual has an available defence. It is sufficient for the court to be aware of the potential that such an offence may be committed by another and to examine how that impacts on the best interests of the child. It is no part of the court’s function to “authorise” the commission of any criminal offence. Any order under the inherent jurisdiction does not do so. Rather, if the inherent jurisdiction is used, then the court “authorises” but does not “require” the placement by a local authority of a child in an unregistered children’s home despite the potential that a person may be prosecuted for and convicted of an offence under section 11 of the Care Standards Act 2000. If a prosecution is brought, which it can be, then it is a matter for the criminal courts to determine whether an offence has been committed and if so, as to the appropriate sentence to impose.</i></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>169.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Secretary of State for Education, in his post-hearing submissions dated 3 June 2021 submits “that the High Court’s inherent jurisdiction&nbsp;can&nbsp;be used to authorise an unregistered placement, but only in circumstances … where a defence to the crime in section 11 of the [Care Standards Act] 2000 can be made out” (emphasis in the original). The defences postulated are “necessity/duress of circumstances”. I agree with the submission of the Secretary of State that the inherent jurisdiction can be used but reject the proposed qualification as to the circumstances in which it can be used. The existence of a defence to a criminal charge misplaces the focus of the inherent jurisdiction which at all times is on the child. The inherent jurisdiction is available despite the potential that a person may be prosecuted for and convicted of an offence under section 11 of the Care Standards Act 2000: that possibility does not abrogate or restrict the inherent jurisdiction. The jurisdiction exists to protect children, not to decide issues of criminal liability.</i></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>170.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with Lady Black, at para 141, that it is “unthinkable that the High Court, with its long-established role in protecting children, should have no means to keep these unfortunate children (and others who may be at risk from them) safe from extreme harm, in some cases death”. I also agree that where “there is absolutely no alternative, and where the child (or someone else) is&nbsp;likely&nbsp;to come to grave harm if the court does not act” that it is “a permissible exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to authorise a local authority to place a child in an unregistered children’s home in relation to which a criminal offence would be being committed” (para 145 above with emphasis added). In this context, as in the context of section 31 of the Children Act 1989 (see Lord Nicholls in&nbsp;In re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof)&nbsp;</i><i><u><span style="color:#0000FF">[1996] AC 563</span></u></i><i>, 585), “likely” should be taken to mean a real possibility, that cannot sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case. Accordingly, the courts, in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction, must only authorise such a placement where there are “imperative considerations of necessity” and where there has been strict compliance with the matters contained in the Guidance issued by the President of the Family Division on 12 November 2019 in relation to placing a child in an unregistered children’s home (“the Guidance”) (see para 147 above) and with the addendum dated 1 December 2020 to the Guidance. Furthermore, if a placement is authorised in an unregistered children’s home then the court must monitor the progress of the application for registration in accordance with the Guidance and, if registration is not achieved, the court must rigorously review its continued approval of the child’s placement in an unregistered home.</i></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>171.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I set out below the matters which must be considered in compliance with the Guidance and the addendum prior to a court authorising a placement in an unregistered children’s home.

The Guidance requires the court to monitor the progress of the application for registration and, if registration is not achieved, to review its continued approval of the child’s placement in an unregistered unit. Paragraph 21 of the Guidance provides that if registration is refused or the applications for registration are withdrawn, the local authority should advise the court as a matter of urgency. It further provides that the court will take this into account when deciding whether the placement of the child in the unregistered children’s home continues to be in the child’s best interests. It is unnecessary to envisage all the sorts of factual situations that might arise which would still call for an order authorising a placement where the children’s home remains unregistered except to say that the test of necessity should be applied all the more strictly and that there will be a heightened level of anxious enquiry and scrutiny. In any event, the Guidance primarily envisages that the children’s home will become registered so that a criminal offence is no longer being committed by others. The Guidance must be followed so that, in practice, within a short period of time the children’s home is registered. This process of registration should continue to be energetically and pro-actively monitored by the courts.”</i></p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_11"><span class="judgment-body__number">11.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Most helpfully, the President of the Family Division Sir Andrew McFarlane P. stated  in <i><u>A Mother v.

It is fundamental that, apart from a “medical or psychiatric examination”, all the court can authorise or direct under section 38(6) is something that can properly be described as an “assessment” and, moreover, an assessment “of the child”. Hence, the need for the primary focus to be on the child, and hence, also, the familiar distinction between an “assessment” of the child (which is permissible) and a programme of therapy or treatment for the parent (which is not). </i></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">33.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Whether a particular programme involves permissible assessment, or some other thing which is impermissible, depends upon an evaluation of the ‘primary purpose’ of what is proposed and whether any otherwise impermissible elements are merely ‘ancillary’ to what is permissible: see the analysis of Thorpe LJ and Simon Brown LJ in Re D (Jurisdiction: Programme of Assessment or Therapy) [1999] 2 FLR 632, approved in Re G by Lord Scott of Foscote at para [11].

I recognise, of course, that that principle will not always be easy to apply. The antithesis between assessment on the one hand and therapy and treatment on the other is at best an imperfect one.

In the first place, although, perhaps because they are the most protracted and expensive and most likely to cut across a local authority’s planning, and thus most likely to be controversial, we tend to think of section 38(6) assessments in terms of residential assessments in the kind of institutional settings of which the Cassell is a well-known example, section 38(6) is much wider and more general in its scope. It applies to any “examination” (medical or psychiatric) or any “assessment”, whether short or long, and in whatever setting. Secondly, subject only to the requirement that the assessment be “of the child”, section 38(6) is not expressed as imposing any restrictions at all on what can be directed by the court. The court can direct any “assessment of the child.” The only further restriction is that suggested by Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s reference in Re C to the purpose of section 38(6) as being “to enable the court to obtain the information necessary for its own decision … to enable it to reach a proper decision at the final hearing of the application for a full care order.” But those words, far from narrowing the scope of section 38(6) merely serve, as it seems to me, to bring out and emphasise the potential breadth of its ambit.</i></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">60.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>The other preliminary observation is this: It is quite plain that, given the reasons why the guardian was arguing for it and, indeed, the reasons the Justices gave for directing it, the assessment directed by the Justices in the present case fell comfortably within the parameters of the permissible as described in Re G in the various passages anthologised in paragraphs [35]-[37] above.

At first, R and his mother were accommodated for a short period pursuant to the mother’s agreement under s20 of the Act. No one has sought to raise any issues about this and I have not heard any submissions on this issue. I consider  this to fall outside the remit of this judgment. A<i>s</i> the position of each of the parties has crystalised, the provisions of  s38(6) of the Act have gained greater prevalence. For entirely correct reasons, it is common ground that the placement is a residential family centre that falls within the definition of the 2004 Act. As such it must be registered with Ofsted. The principal issue is whether the court can sanction the placement of the families in the face of noncompliance with the statutory requirements.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_19"><span class="judgment-body__number">19.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This court’s inherent jurisdiction can be applied in many varied circumstances. The authorities that are cited above are but a limited number of examples of circumstances in which this jurisdiction has been utilised.  The Supreme Court’s decision in <i><u>Re T</u></i> and subsequent cases such as <i><u>A Mother v. Derby City Council</u></i> clearly illustrate the court’s jurisdiction being invoked to protect some of the most venerable children in our society. It is not surprising that at first the local authority in these two instant case sought to follow an analogous path as set out in the two aforementioned authorities.  However, this jurisdiction is not without limits and in this instance the combination of two important statutory provisions, namely s100(3) and s38(6) of the Act  make an insurmountable prohibition on the use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction. This prohibition is further fortified by PD12D. It follows that in the face of the available statutory means through which such a placement may be directed, the use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction is inappropriate. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_20"><span class="judgment-body__number">20.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Therefore the principal issue remains, namely, can this court sanction the placement of each child and parent in the face of statutory provisions  that render the placement illegal? In my judgment, the answer is clearly set out in <i><u>A (A Child), Re [2009</u></i><i>]</i> EWHC 865 (Fam) as detailed above. To accept a submission that the court cannot make such a direction in these circumstances, would involve <i>“reading into s38(6) words of restrictions which are simply not there … </i>[and] <i>would cut across the statutory purpose …</i> <i>“. </i>Cafcass and the guardian in the first case (Re K) appear to tacitly accept that the door is open to the court to give directions for the assessment of K in the placement, but they argue that this case is distinguishable where unlike <i><u>A (A Child), Re [2009</u></i><i>]</i> EWHC 865 (Fam), the placement is a commercial entity and fall outside the circumstances of the 2009 case. Furthermore, it would be against (public) policy for the court to direct such a placement knowing that it falls foul of the statutory framework. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_21"><span class="judgment-body__number">21.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At first blush these concerns are entirely logical and well placed in the circumstances that may be said that the two statutory regimes may be potentially in conflict. However, in my judgment such an approach is fundamentally flawed and unsustainable. Whilst not a commercial placement, this point was addressed head on in <i><u>A (A Child), Re [2009</u></i><i>]</i> EWHC 865 (Fam). The terms of s38(6) provide for  one of the few examples where the court can interfere with the local authority’s exercise of its parental responsibility  under the terms of an Interim Care Order. Indeed these are squarely within the circumstances that Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <i><u>Re C</u></i>  saw as in <i>“in the interest of justice” </i>for the court to retain such a power. The purpose of making such a directions under the said provisions, is to enable the court to have available the necessary information to make a decision on what best serves the subject child’s welfare. Furthermore, although the said authority was concerned with the Welsh Regulations, the assessment of the courts powers as set out in paragraph 63 of the said judgment is clear and has equal application to the two cases before me. Therefore, as a matter of law and policy it is an essential part of the courts function and duties to be able to direct such assessments in settings that are judged to be appropriate for the relevant child and necessary to inform the outcome of the case.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_22"><span class="judgment-body__number">22.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Once the court’s power to make directions under s38(6) of the Act are engaged, the court must then assess whether it is appropriate to give such a direction. Latterly, the arguments as to whether the current placement falls within the ambit of these provisions have not been pursued with great zest. However, for completeness, given authorities that I have cited above, in my judgment this placement is clearly a residential placement whose function in assessing the children is part fulfilled  and in other parts are ancillary to the fulfilment of the assessment of each of these children. Therefore it falls well within the ambit of s38(6).There is no dispute between the parties that each of these families should be the subject of a residential assessment and without hesitation I endorse this accord which is founded in the premise of necessity to provide the court with important and essential information to be able to make decisions about the welfare of each of these children.</p></div></section><section><p><u>Conclusion</u></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_23"><span class="judgment-body__number">23.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Save for the element of costs which are met by  the local authority, having considered the provisions of s38(6) and (7), I am satisfied that the placement should continue with an assessment of each of the children and I accordingly direct it so.

The parties and the court must be given the appropriate information to understand the purpose and length of any proposed assessment.  If such a placement is to assess the relevant child, such a placement may be directed pursuant to s38(6) of the Act and the use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction is not appropriate regardless of the placement’s registration status. The provisions of s38(6) are one of the limited circumstances in which the court may interfere with the local authority’s exercise of parental responsibility for a child who is the subject of an interim care order. Its provisions are widely construed and are not limited to residential settings. They include medical or psychiatric assessment of the child as well as other elements of assessment that are ancillary to the primary assessment of the child.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_25"><span class="judgment-body__number">25.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">An application pursuant to the said provisions of the Act must be made in writing and supported with a statement that addresses the criteria that is set out in s38(7) of the Act together with any additional relevant information, including the necessity of such an assessment. Such an application and supporting documents give important notice to all of the parties. allowing them to respond and to properly participate in the proceedings. In cases of emergencies such the first instant case and subject to the court’s case management powers to make specific directions in this regard,  all of these steps must be completed as soon it is practicable. </p></div></section></section></article></body></html>
