                     not a consumer) VP Lux, which accepts the burden on this issue falls on it, seeks
                     to rely on what it says are exclusive jurisdiction clause (“EJCs”). VP Lux relies,
                     as against MDM, on an EJC in a letter, between Emmediemme, Skew Base GP, and VP Lux.
                     VP Lux also relies, against both C1 and C2 on what it says is an EJC contained in
                     the Subscription documents under which the investments were made. If either of those
                     EJC arguments prevail, as to which the parties agree that the standard is simply whether
                     VP Lux has the better of the argument, the EJCs mean that this Court can have no jurisdiction.
                     If not, the question is whether an exception to BRR applies. The Claimants rely on
                     BRR Art 8(1), saying that the claim against VP Lux is so closely connected with the
                     claim against XY and/or Mr Migani that is expedient to hear and determine them together;

                     parties were agreed that the following list of issues and route map accurately captures
                     the issues which might arise for decision, although of course some outcomes on certain
                     issues would obviate the need to decide other issues, and for reasons which I shall
                     explain I do not need, in the event, need to decide every one of these issues in order
                     to deal with these applications. It is also important to note that the VP Lux and
                     VP Liecht issues are to some extent interdependent since (for instance) the decision
                     whether to exercise discretion to permit service out on VP Liecht might be exercised
                     differently depending on whether VP Lux were going to be sued here.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, that formulation contains no requirement that the loss or injury intended by
                           the defendant be the same, either in kind or in extent, as the loss in fact sustained
                           by the Claimant. The parties were agreed that it is not an essential element of this
                           tort that the injury intended and the injury sustained should be the same. But there
                           must be loss or damage that was as a matter of fact caused by the unlawful acts, otherwise
                           there would be no causal connection between the wrong and the loss for which compensation
                           is sought. In this respect I accept Mr Saoul QC’s submission, for the Claimants, that
                           it should not be surprising that, in an intentional tort which connotes a high degree
                           of reprehensibility, the losses recovered do not need to align with the losses that
                           were intended, in broadly the same way that damages in the tort of deceit extend to
                           all losses flowing directly from the tort, whether or not foreseeable.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, this formulation contains a reminder that, even at trial, there may be elements
                           of the tort for which there is no direct evidence, and the Claimant is reliant on
                           the drawing of inferences. Mr Saoul submitted, and I accept, that in approaching Issue
                           1 I must be mindful of the fact that, especially at this early stage, before the VP
                           Defendants have pleaded a defence, let alone given disclosure, it ought not to be
                           surprising if direct evidence of the existence of a combination, or of intent, were
                           lacking.

                     that the conspirator knew of all of the facts which make the acts unlawful: see per
                     Arnold LJ (with whom Phillips LJ agreed, Lewison LJ dissenting on this point in relation
                     to cases where the unlawful means was some violation of a private law right): <u>Racing Partnership v Done Bros Ltd </u>[2020] EWCA Civ 1300 at [139-144].

                           had discussed whether the offering documents should disclose the relationship with
                           Twinkle under the Tripartite Services Agreement and had decided that there was no

                           state of affairs in which the impression given to investors is that XY is advising
                           them to invest into an entirely independent fund, whereas the truth is that the adviser
                           has a very considerable personal interest in the investors doing so, because fees
                           earned in the first instance by the VP entities almost entirely find their way back
                           to Mr Migani.

                     that VP Liecht had knowledge of the facts constituting the unlawful means, that is
                     to say the facts constituting the fraudulent making of the independence representations,
                     and the breaches by XY of its fiduciary duties and Mr Migani’s knowing assistance
                     in those breaches.

                     matters I do not consider that I can say that there is no real prospect of the trial
                     judge inferring such knowledge. The facts prayed in aid at this stage by the Claimants
                     are essentially the same as those they rely on in relation to the existence of the
                     combination. I stress that I accept that it is perfectly possible that the VP Defendants
                     had no knowledge, nor even any suspicion, that Mr Migani and XY might have been presenting
                     the Skew Base Fund as independent when in fact it was not; but I do not consider that
                     I can be so confident that those allegations will fail that I can say that there is
                     no serious issue to be tried.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems to me that if this case proceeds to trial the judge may or may not draw the
                     inferences against the VP Defendants upon which the Claimant seek to rely. Whether
                     he or she does so will depend on what has happened on disclosure and on what evidence
                     the VP Defendants chose to call. But it seems to me there is amply sufficient material
                     pleaded against the VP Liecht at this stage for me to be able to say that as things
                     stand there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether or not VP Liecht was party
                     to a combination to use the unlawful means alleged, and as to VP Liecht’s knowledge
                     of the facts constituting those unlawful means.

                     this point more difficult. He says that as a matter of law the pleaded case on injury
                     is unsustainable because the harms alleged at #104 of the POC are incapable of satisfying
                     the requirements of the tort; and he says that in any event there is no serious issue
                     to be tried in relation to inferred intention to injure.

                              either as an end in itself or as a means to an end. A defendant may intend to harm
                              the claimant as an end in itself where, for instance, he has a grudge against the
                              claimant. More usually a defendant intentionally inflicts harm on a claimant’s business
                              as a means to an end. He inflicts damage as the means whereby to protect or promote

                              The defendant’s conduct in relation to the loss must be deliberate. In particular,

                              where loss to the claimant is the obverse side of the coin from gain to the defendant.
                              The defendant’s gain and the claimant’s loss are, to the defendant’s knowledge, inseparably

                              ([1992] 1 AC 448). The argument that someone who wishes to obtain an asset from the

                     in ignorance of a basis for refusing to entertain the offer or asking for more favourable
                     terms, does not intend to injure.

                     in ignorance of some fact about his adviser which might very well be expected, if
                     the investor knew of it, either to put the investor off the package altogether, or
                     at least to cause the investor to seek better terms (including perhaps a rebate of
                     the monies circling back to the adviser).

                     that the NPP gateway is met if the claim against VP Lux is to proceed in this Court,
                     and also accept that, if that is so, England and Wales is clearly and distinctly the
                     most appropriate forum and discretion should be exercised to permit service out.

                     arising out of the subscription once made. Once the investment has subscribed for,
                     the letter agreement becomes history, and going forward the parties’ obligations depend

                           now Art 23 of BRR] is to be applied must be interpreted in the light of the effect
                           of the conferment of jurisdiction by consent, which is to exclude both the jurisdiction
                           determined by the general principle laid down in Article 2 and the special jurisdictions
                           provided for in Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention. In view of the consequences that
                           such an option may have on the position of the parties to the action, the requirements
                           set out in Article 17 governing the validity of clauses conferring jurisdiction must
                           be strictly construed. By making such validity subject to the existence of an “agreement”
                           between the parties, Article 17 imposes on the court before which the matter is brought
                           the duty of examining, first, whether the clause conferring jurisdiction upon it was
                           in fact the subject of a consensus between the parties, which must be clearly and
                           precisely demonstrated. The purpose of the formal requirements imposed by Article

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The question I must ask is therefore whether or not the agreement to the jurisdiction
                     of the Luxembourg Courts on which Mr Blakeley relies was the subject of a consensus
                     which is clearly and precisely demonstrated. I am not satisfied that it was. The position
                     seems to me to have been, on any objective view, confusing. The Subscription Form
                     contained a choice of law clause but no accompanying choice of jurisdiction clause.
                     That is an unpromising start. The most that Mr Blakeley can say is that the Subscription
                     Form incorporated the Offering document by reference, and the Offering Document stated
                     that the Subscription Form contained a “choice of international competence” of the
                     Court of Luxembourg. But in fact it didn’t. Mr Blakeley points to the provision at
                     the end of the Subscription Form which says that in the case of “differences between
                     the information in the Application Form and the Fund’s Offering Documents the latter
                     shall prevail.” I am not satisfied that what is in issue here is properly characterised
                     is a difference in “information” between the two forms.

                     to what the EJC in the Letter Agreement, and to what the Offering Document said about
                     jurisdiction. Whilst these issues are highly material to VP Lux, they seem to me to
                     be of only very passing relevance to VP Liecht and in my view, Mr Blakeley was right
                     not to press this point with any vigour. I find there was no breach of the duty of
                     fair presentation on this point.

                     written in Italian, English translations of which have since been disclosed. The English
                     translations suggest that Mr Nuzzo knew that XY or its officers were controlling the
                     Skew Base Funds, a point which if correct would be relevant to the strength of the
                     claims in deceit, and therefore of some relevance to the strength of the claim against
                     VP Liecht. But Mr Nuzzo says that the true meaning of the Italian he used was simply
                     that XY was monitoring or watching the Skew Base Funds. In those circumstances it
                     seems to me that there is – in terms of non-disclosure - nothing in this point.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The third alleged non-disclosure is that the Claimants did not disclose to Butcher
                     J the fact that, at the time that application was made, that they had also invested
                     in the real estate compartment of the Fund and that that investment was up by some
                     11%. Mr Blakeley says that these facts were and are relevant to the question of whether
                     or not the VP defendants intended to injure the Claimants. He further submits that
                     the non-disclosure is aggravated by the way the claim was pleaded which suggested
                     that the investments about which complaint is made were the only investments made.
                     I agree that the POC at least gives the impression that the only investments made
                     were those that sustained heavy losses.

                           in value. This seems to me to be no answer at all and irrelevant. The complaint is
                           that it was misleading not to disclose the investments that were at that stage “in
                           the money” and it is no answer to say that they might subsequently have fallen in
                           value before they were able to realise it.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, they say that the performance of the successful investments is not relevant
                           to whether or not the Defendants intended that the Claimants would suffer injury,
                           because the nature of the harm alleged to have been intended is confined to the detriment
                           of not being independently advised.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to this second point, I have already held that the Claimants’ distinction between
                     intended harm and the damage in fact sustained is a valid distinction, and it follows
                     from that that the non-disclosure is not in fact material.

                     because the failure to do so inevitably left the court on the ex parte application
                     with an incomplete view of the overall factual matrix, but given that the non-disclosure
                     was in fact irrelevant and given that, even if it ought to have been disclosed the
                     disclosure would have made no difference, it does not seem to me that VP Liecht is
                     entitled to have the order for service out set aside.

                     is to consider the AmPOC because even if the technically correct version to use were
                     the original POC, and even if differences between the two versions were to give rise
                     to a different outcome in terms of the applications, there is no imminent limitation
                     issue in this case and the Claimants would then just start again with their amended

                     not turn on very fine points of pleading because the court ought to be concerned with
