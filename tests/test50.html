It was, therefore, open to the Appellant to produce evidence that was not before the Respondent when it made its review decision and invite the FTT to reach factual conclusions different from those that the Respondent reached in its review. Moreover, the Appellant was entitled to argue that, in the light of those different factual conclusions, the Respondent’s decision was unreasonable.
