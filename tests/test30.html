                     indictment concerning an allegation that he had in his possession two offensive weapons
                     contrary to the Prevention of Crime Act 1953.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Fraser was attending a petrol station on 27 October 2019 when police officers,
                     who also happened to be present at that petrol station, looked into his vehicle and
                     saw a pair of handcuffs. They searched the vehicle and found other items that might
                     have been used by a police officer and in particular a chest rig and two extendable
                     metal batons.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Fraser did not dispute that he possessed the batons and nor was it the defendant’s
                     case that they did not amount to offensive weapons. As the prosecution’s opening note
                     said, at paragraph 29:

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“The issue in the case is primarily whether the Defendant had a reasonable excuse
                           for having the items in the circumstances that he had them on 27 October 2019. So,
                           we are not concerned why he might have purchased or possessed the items generally,
                           but whether on that specific occasion in public he had a reasonable excuse for having
                           them out with him. The defendant states he was transporting them home in his car from
                           his mother’s address.”

                     officers at the scene, the prosecution relied upon material on the defendant’s mobile
                     phone and from which an extraction report running to 1,691 pages was produced. Separately
                     there were 9,322 still photographic images on the phone and a further 1,425 video
                     files.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The prosecution relied upon five photographs which appeared to show Mr Fraser wearing
                     the seized items and one video clip showing him miming to a song whilst wearing the
                     chest rig. By the time of the second interview of Mr Fraser, his solicitor, had provided
                     to the police officer involved two video clips, one of which was different from the
                     one relied on by the prosecution, and one further still photograph.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It would appear that the defendant did not wish to rely upon the statement given to
                     the police that the materials were simply being transported from his mother’s address
                     to his home as constituting a reasonable excuse for having offensive weapons in his
                     car. If he had done so, there would have been no need to rely upon any photographs
                     or videos. Instead, his defence was that he had the materials as part of his performance
                     on Tik Tok videos which he produced for his considerable number of followers. Consequently,
                     the existence of photographs or videos of him in preparation for or carrying out such
                     performances was central to that defence.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Fraser was acquitted by the jury and his counsel sought to ensure that the photographic
                     material was to be treated as served evidence. This was confirmed by both the prosecution
                     and the trial judge. The court log suggests that Mr Fraser’s counsel sought to obtain
                     further rulings regarding the evidence, but the judge went no further than confirming
                     it was served and relied upon.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the purposes of the graduated fee claim, the solicitors claimed not only the paper
                     evidence which was allowed at 32 pages but also the entirety of the extraction report
                     and the images to seek the maximum PPE of 10,000 pages. The determining officer allowed
                     77 pages of the electronic evidence and so assessed the PPE at 109 pages in this case.
                     The solicitors’ appeal is against that allowance.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The solicitors’ first challenge to the determining officer’s decision refers to the
                     requirement in the 2013 Regulations for the determining officer to consider whether
                     or not the evidence would have been served in paper form prior to the entry into the
                     digital age on 1 April 2012. This is not a threshold requirement that is really pursued
                     by the determining officer any longer since the evidence as to what was and was not
                     originally printed out was inconsistent even when such matters were considered shortly
                     after that date. 
                  </p>
               </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_11"><span class="judgment-body__number">11.</span><div>
                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">But in this case matters are further confused by the solicitors’ argument appearing
                     to reverse the requirement in any event. The solicitors correctly refer to evidence
                     being served in paper form before being converted to a digital format as potentially
                     remunerated as PPE. But they then refer to a document which must have been provided
                     electronically which they have subsequently printed out in order to work through it
                     more easily. That is electronic evidence which has become a paper document rather
                     than having been served as a paper document. In any event, as I have said the demonstration
                     of evidence have been previously used in paper form is no longer a restriction imposed
                     by determining officers.  This is fortunate for the solicitors because to suggest
                     that the solicitors preferred method of working equates in any way to how the prosecution
                     would originally have served the document 10 years ago is not one which has any weight.
                  </p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The determining officer’s role under the 2013 Regulations is to consider whether electronic
                     evidence should be treated as being sufficiently important to equate to paper evidence
                     so that it counts as being part of the PPE overall. If it does not reach that threshold,
                     then the solicitors are still able to claim a fee by way of special preparation at
                     an hourly rate for considering the prosecution’s served evidence. That is the suggestion
                     of both the determining officer and indeed Mr Michael Rimer of the Legal Aid Agency
                     who appeared at the video hearing of this appeal.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is the Agency’s answer to the point made in this case by the solicitors (and by
                     their counsel Mr Halliday on the appeal hearing), as indeed it is made in many other
                     cases, that <u>all</u> of the prosecution’s served evidence had to be considered by the solicitors. If the
                     determining officer takes the view that it would not be appropriate to include all
                     of the electronic evidence as PPE “taking into account the nature of the document
                     and any other relevant circumstances” then the remainder can still be paid for via
                     a claim for special preparation. The issue is then whether the determining officer
                     was right to conclude that it would not be appropriate to include all of the evidence
                     as PPE.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Reliance is placed by the solicitors on the decision of Costs Judge Nagalingam in
                     <u>R v King</u> where he made the point that the PDF provided by the prosecution may need to be considered
                     in its entirety before deciding whether the evidence was in fact important. As such
                     an element of hindsight was being introduced by the determining officer to a task
                     which the solicitor could do nothing other than look at all of the material.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">What is not always apparent is that the case of <u>King</u> was unusual in that the PDF report provided by the prosecution did not contain any
                     bookmarks or other method by which the areas of the report could be considered before
                     being reviewed. It was simply a question of starting at the first page and ending
                     at the last. Experience has shown that this is a rare situation, and it does not apply
                     here. The extraction report has been provided to me and I have checked that it does
                     contain the usual bookmarking approach so that the document can be navigated as to
                     the elements which would appear to be important. Consequently, the <u>King</u> approach does not apply here and the determining officer was entirely right to consider
                     the importance of the elements of the report in the usual way.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It might be thought that the trial judge’s comments about the evidence not only being
                     served but also relied upon would be of assistance to the solicitors in this appeal.
                     I do not read the court clerk’s note in that light, but even if the judge was attempting
                     to assist the solicitors regarding the electronic evidence, such assistance stops
                     at the point at which the determining officer has to consider the application of the
                     regulations and the decisions of Costs Judges and High Court judges as to the applicability
                     of those regulations. Purely by way of illustration, it was determined many years
                     ago that moving sound and images (<u>Lord Chancellor v McLarty &amp; Co Solicitors</u> [2011] EWHC 3182 (QB)) e.g. videos did not count as PPE and consequently the pages
                     on the extraction report concerning the videos could not be recovered regardless of
                     any instruction by the trial judge.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The extraction report is unusual in that it contains no messaging or communications
                     sections but is simply made up of images and videos together with the technical information
                     regarding the extraction itself. The defence obtained legal aid approval to instruct
                     a telecommunications expert in this case and Mr Rimer made the point that this expert
                     would also have considered the images and that was a relevant circumstance for the
                     determining officer to take into account. He pointed to the fact that the prosecution
                     only relied upon a very limited number of photographs from the download and the defence
                     had not produced very many further photographs which they considered to be relevant
                     either before the second interview or indeed before the trial. Mr Rimer expanded the
                     point by suggesting that the defence could have provided photographs from other sources
                     to bolster the argument that Mr Fraser regularly used the seized materials as props
                     for his performances.

                     I do not think, ultimately, it adds to the consideration of the importance of the

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For some considerable time, the allowance of images under the 2013 Regulations was
                     something of an all or nothing affair. Either the images were considered to be sufficiently
                     important that they were all part of the PPE or they were too peripheral for any of
                     them to be allowed. That position changed when the Senior Costs Judge, Andrew Gordon-Saker,
                     gave his decision in the case of <u>R v Sereika</u> on 12 December 2018. In that case he said, at paragraph 16:

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“In this particular case, the exercise of that discretion is not easy. On the one
                           hand the prosecution chose to serve this evidence as an exhibit. Given the nature
                           of the defence, that the phone was used by others, it is not difficult to conclude
                           the solicitors would have wished to look for photographs indicating that use. On the
                           other hand, it is unlikely that the vast majority of those photographs would have
                           been relevant to that task. It would seem unlikely that the solicitors would have
                           looked in detail at each of the 20,608 images served on disc. Most will have required
                           a glance or less.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems to me that that is the situation in this case. The solicitors needed to look
                     at the photographs to see whether there were more pictures of the defendant dressed
                     in the seized materials. However, where there is a picture of someone other than the
                     defendant, for example, the picture cannot possibly be relevant to the search nor
                     can it realistically be said to be of sufficient importance to be one which ought
                     to be treated as if it was the equivalent of paper PPE.

                           The solicitors were required to consider the phone evidence carefully. However, much
                           of the evidence on the phone would not require consideration.

                           (or costs judge on appeal) should not take a broad approach and conclude that as only
                           a proportion of the images may be of real relevance to the case, only that proportion
                           should be included in the page count. Inevitably that will be nothing more than “rough
                           justice, in the sense of being compounded of much sensible approximation”: per Russell
                           LJ in <i>In re Eastwood</i> [1974] 3 WLR 454 at 458. But that is the nature of the assessment of costs.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is my experience that in PPE appeals, there is regularly a criticism of determining
                     officers moving too quickly to a Sereika percentage approach when the primary decision
                     ought to be whether all of the images should be allowed. Inevitably, any cases where
                     the determining officer has already allowed all of the images will not be ones on
                     which an appeal is brought. Consequently, the ones I see are those where only some
                     of the images, if any, have been allowed. It would be fair to say, that very few of
                     such cases seem to allow a specific number of images rather than a percentage of the
                     total (which then leads to a specific figure).

                     pages of the extraction report containing the images and it is plain that most of
                     them are irrelevant and that this would be apparent from “a glance or less.” As a
                     result, I uphold the determining officer’s decision to take a percentage approach
                     in relation to the images which were clearly central to the case in principle but
                     the contents of the phone were largely irrelevant.

                     was appropriate in this case. Mr Rimer suggested, at least in his written submissions,
                     that the determining officer was generous to allow any percentage. But, given the
                     centrality of the images, I do not consider that argument to be right.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Halliday contended for all of the images to be allowed but I do not think that
                     is the correct position either. The defendant produced barely a single photograph
                     from his own resources prior to a second interview. The solicitors say that over 200
                     images were in fact relevant from the extraction report albeit that was challenged
                     by Mr Rimer on the basis they simply showed the defendant, for example, in a black
                     T-shirt. My consideration of the images did not suggest that there were very many
                     at all which were actually relevant. There were bound to be some which needed to be
                     considered in more detail to decide upon their relevance and they would be the sort
                     of photographs for which consideration comparable to paper PPE would be appropriate.
                     It seems to me that the figure of 200 images or thereabouts is the high watermark
                     of the solicitors’ case.

                     77 pages of the report in total. Since there were several pictures to each page, the
                     number of images allowed by the determining officer’s decision is 466.  It would only
                     be if each image had to be looked at as a full page rather than a thumbnail image
                     for the 200 images to amount to more than has been allowed in any event.  Given the
                     discrete nature of the photographs which might be relevant, I have no doubt that the
                     thumbnais were perfectly adequate for deciding upon the (lack of) relevance of the
                     great majority of the images.

                     use of the determining officer’s discretion in considering all the circumstances and
                     the nature of the documents. Those 77 pages amount to PPE and the viewing of the other
                     pages can be claimed by way of special preparation.
