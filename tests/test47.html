We describe those appealable matters in relation to income tax as the “<b>income tax matters</b>”, and the appealable matters in respect of VAT as the “<b>VAT matters</b>”. The income tax matters, and the VAT matters are collectively described as the “<b>appealable matters</b>”. Originally there were over 50 appealable matters , but by the time of the hearing, these had been whittled down to those detailed in Appendix 1.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_2"><span class="judgment-body__number">2.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appealable matters arise out of enquiries commenced in respect of VAT, by HMRC in 2013, and in respect of income tax by HMRC in March 2017.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_3"><span class="judgment-body__number">3.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In a nutshell, the appellant’s position as regards the VAT matters is that notification of them was never sent by HMRC nor received by him. Even if he was on notice of those matters by dint of their inclusion in the bankruptcy petition of 11 June 2018 (the “<b>bankruptcy petition</b>”) there was insufficient detail of the VAT matters in the bankruptcy petition to enable him to make an appeal, and HMRC did not provide him with the requisite detail notwithstanding repeated requests for it. Once he had sufficient detail, he made an appeal. This was on 28 September 2020. HMRC’s position as regards the VAT matters is that the relevant notices were both sent and received by the appellant or his agent. Even if that was not the case, there was sufficient detail in the bankruptcy petition to enable the appellant to make an appeal, and indeed that is what the appellant’s current representative did as regards some but not all of the appealable matters, on 28 September 2020. There is no evidence of the appellant’s former agent asking for detailed information over and above that set out in the bankruptcy petition between the date of that petition, and the date of the limited appeal on 28 September 2020.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_4"><span class="judgment-body__number">4.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As regards the appellant’s position concerning the income tax matters, it is slightly different. The appellant accepts that the relevant notices were served by HMRC and received by himself or his agent, but that agent employed two individuals who, for reasons unknown to anyone, simply failed to action those notices. This was against their office policy, and the individuals have been dismissed. The appellant’s position regarding the information in the bankruptcy petition is the same as his position in respect of the VAT matters. HMRC’s position too is the same as regards the information in the bankruptcy petition, and the fact that the appellant could readily have brought an appeal immediately following the bankruptcy petition but did not do so, on a limited basis, until 28 September 2020. And the behaviour of the appellant’s agent’s employees was nothing more than failure to comply with office procedure. The failings of that agent should be imputed to the appellant.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_5"><span class="judgment-body__number">5.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the reasons given in more detail later in this decision, we have dismissed the appellant’s application for permission to bring his appeals out of time.</p></div></section></section><section><p><b>THE LAW</b></p><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_6"><span class="judgment-body__number">6.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There was no dispute about the applicable legislation which is set out in Appendix 2.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_7"><span class="judgment-body__number">7.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Nor was there any dispute about the essential case law which is relevant to this application.<span style="color:#000000"> In considering whether to admit a late appeal to the FTT, the Upper Tribunal in </span><i><span style="color:#000000">Martland v HMRC </span></i><span style="color:#000000">[2018] UKUT 178 (TCC) (“</span><b><i><span style="color:#000000">Martland</span></i></b><span style="color:#000000">”) considered that the approach to applications for relief from sanctions under CPR rule 3.9 should apply to applications for permission to appeal to the FTT outside the relevant statutory limit.

It is important however that this should not descend into a detailed analysis of the underlying merits of the appeal……”</p></div></section></section><section><p><b>THE EVIDENCE AND FINDINGS OF FACT</b></p><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_8"><span class="judgment-body__number">8.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We were provided with a significant bundle of documents and a lesser supplementary bundle. The appellant tendered a witness statement and gave oral evidence on which he was cross examined. Further oral evidence was given by Mr Matthew Bailey the managing director of Howards chartered accountants (“<b>Howards</b>”) who were the appellant’s former tax advisers. From this evidence we find the following:</p></div></section></section><section><p><i>Service of notices</i></p><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(1)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The documents included copies of the appealable matters.

Nor was he aware of any notification of the VAT matters. Even if the notices had been sent to him, he did not receive them. Yet in his oral testimony, the appellant accepted that, for example, he received a letter dated 14 July 2017 from HMRC dealing with his VAT position and passed this letter on to Howards. Furthermore, the appellant emailed HMRC on 26 June 2017 as regards VAT and was able to say “I am just finishing getting all the VAT invoices together…” This was in response to an email from HMRC indicating that they had “not received any response to my schedule 36 notices request for purchase invoices”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(3)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Bailey’s witness statement indicated that he was aware of and dealt with the enquiry made by HMRC into the VAT position of the appellant but was not aware of an enquiry into the appellant’s self-assessment tax return which commenced in 2017. He goes on to say that had he been aware of that enquiry he would have corresponded with HMRC as he was already doing that in respect of the VAT enquiry. In his second witness statement, however, he corrected this, and indicated that during his preparation for the hearing on 15 March 2022, letters from HMRC to Howards relating to the income tax self-assessment enquiry were identified and brought to his attention.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(4)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his oral evidence Mr Bailey said that this was restricted to HMRC’s letter of 10 March 2017 opening the enquiry, Howard’s letter to HMRC of 24 November 2017 and HMRC’s letter to the appellant dated 27 October 2017 (dealing with the closure notice and the possibility of imposing penalties). It is also clear from the oral evidence of the appellant that Mr Bailey was aware of the letter sent to the appellant by HMRC on 14 July 2017, against which there was no appeal right, but his oral evidence was that he had not seen any of the VAT matters.</p></div></section></section><section><p><i>Howards’ employees</i></p><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(5)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At the relevant time, Howards employed two individuals, Paul Hodson and Kelly Bird. It was Mr Bailey’s oral evidence that these individuals were tasked with the day-to-day management of the appellant’s tax affairs. Howards had been instructed by the appellant as regards these affairs since around July 2016.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(6)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The documentary evidence shows that there was a telephone conversation between Paul and HMRC’s officer, Mr Thomas, on 5 June 2017 in which the former explained to the latter that he had asked for business records from the appellant in order to comply with the information requests. Mr Thomas indicated that the deadline for sending information had passed and that the appellant will be charged a £300 penalty. To avoid further penalties, all of the requested information should be sent as soon as possible.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(7)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A further conversation between the same parties took place on 11 June 2017, again dealing with the information, Mr Thomas indicated that the requested information had not been received. A further conversation about business records took place on 17 January 2018 between the same individuals. It was also Mr Bailey’s evidence that the letter of 24 November 2017 had been written by Paul.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(8)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his first witness statement, Mr Bailey suggests that one reason that Paul had sent this letter was because he intended to acquire the appellant as a client of a business that he, Paul, was setting up in competition with Howards. He also speculated that this might be the reason why there is no correspondence on the file and why he had no knowledge of the income tax enquiry. As mentioned above, this is corrected in his second witness statement, on the basis that whilst he had no personal knowledge, there was correspondence on Howards’ files which appears never to have been actioned.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(9)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his oral evidence, Mr Bailey said that Paul had not been authorised to deal with the matters referred to and discussed in the telephone conversation which should have been dealt with by Mr Bailey. Mr Bailey was not aware of the telephone conversations. Nor was he aware of Paul’s letter to HMRC on 24 November 2017 which, responding to a letter from HMRC, should have been dealt with by either Mr Bailey or a fellow director. This was Howards’ policy, something of which the employees would have been aware.</p></div></section></section><section><p><i>The bankruptcy petition</i></p><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(10)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The bankruptcy petition is a creditors bankruptcy petition for failure to comply with a statutory demand for a liquidated sum.

It was brought by HMRC who applied for a bankruptcy order against the appellant who, HMRC claimed, was indebted to them in the sum of £200,844. The particulars of this debt are listed over two pages. There are approximately 50 entries which are itemised under a number of headings, for example self-assessed payments on account, penalties, national insurance contributions, taxes act penalties for failure to comply with schedule 36 FA 2008, VAT due under sections 25 and 73 VAT act 1994 and surcharges under section 76 of that act.

It is clear to us that the length of delay, is tested from the date on which the appealable notices were issued, is both serious and significant. As submitted by Ms Davies, the delays are in the region of 1,000 days at least. However, Mr Avient submits that time should not start on the date on which the notices were issued, but only when they were received by the appellant, since to be valid notices they had to be validly notified. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_15"><span class="judgment-body__number">15.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">His primary position is that HMRC have not established that the appealable matters were validly notified to the appellant in the first place. All they have provided, as evidence, are copies of the appealable matters and covering letters. This does not satisfy the first limb of section 7 Interpretation Act 1978. We disagree. This is not a case where HMRC have simply produced a computer printout and asked us to infer from that that it must have been sent to an appellant. HMRC have provided copies of the appealable matters and covering letters, all of which the appellant had accepted in evidence have been correctly addressed. HMRC have not produced an officer to speak to the system that they adopt towards putting these letters into envelopes and ensuring that those envelopes are prepaid, but the presumption of regularity has not been displaced by the appellant in this case. There is no evidence of “return to sender”.We find that it is more likely than not that the copies of the documents which have been produced to us were put into prepaid envelopes and, having been correctly addressed, sent to the appellant. And, where copies were sent to Howards, they were sent to Howards.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_16"><span class="judgment-body__number">16.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Having found as a fact that the appealable matters were served on the appellant or Howards, we must consider whether the appellant’s assertion that he did not receive them is proof of that fact. As regards the VAT matters, there appears to be a distinction between those matters which were sent by email, which the appellant accepts that he received, and those which were sent by post, of which appellant denies receipt. Mr Avient submits that this is a logical distinction. Ms Davies points out that the appellant’s evidence on this is confused; at one point he accepted that he had received the penalty notices, but not received the income tax or VAT assessments. But the appellant appeared to deny this in re-examination. We accept that there is evidence to show that the appellant had passed emails he had received from HMRC to Howards, and that he had passed a letter from HMRC to them. On the basis of this we are prepared to accept that had he received the VAT matters he would have sent them to Howards. And the fact that Howards received none is evidence that the appellant had not received them in the first place. We are, therefore, prepared to accept his evidence that he did not receive the VAT matters.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_17"><span class="judgment-body__number">17.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">But this is to be distinguished from the income tax matters which we find were validly notified to Howards at or around the date on which they were sent to that firm.

We believe this to be a typo, and the date was 23 July 2018. We say this on the basis that the appellant’s case is that HMRC were continuously dilatory in responding to repeated requests for clarification of the matters set out in the bankruptcy petition between 2018 and 2020, and because of that inTax were instructed, in September 2020, to resolve the position. If the bankruptcy petition been received only in July 2020, this submission would fall away since it seems to us that HMRC could not have been over dilatory between July 2020 and September 2020. Furthermore, the letter itself refers to a letter of 2 July 2020 requesting a breakdown of credits, which could not have been sent had the bankruptcy petition only come to Howards’ attention 3 weeks later on 23 July 2020. We find as a fact that the bankruptcy petition came to Howards’ attention on 23 July 2018.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_20"><span class="judgment-body__number">20.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So since that date, it had been clear to Howards that HMRC had assessed the appellant to tax and visited penalty notices on the appellant in respect of those matters identified in the bankruptcy petition. If therefore we take the date as starting on 23 July 2018 and ending on the date of the earliest appeal on 28 September 2020, the delay is still over 2 years. This is serious and significant, and we do not believe that the appellant would argue to the contrary.</p></div></section><section><p><i>Reasons for the delay</i></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_21"><span class="judgment-body__number">21.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Turning now to the reasons for the delay, Mr Avient submits that one good reason is that the appellant never received the VAT notices. And we accept that that is a good reason for not bringing a timely appeal. But as we say above, the appellant was on notice on and from 23 July 2018 that HMRC had assessed those VAT matters which were set out in the bankruptcy petition.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_22"><span class="judgment-body__number">22.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Avient draws a distinction between the VAT matters on one hand and the income tax matters on the other. He accepts that the income tax matters had been notified to the appellant by dint of valid service on and receipt by Howards. But although the general rule is that failings by an agent should be attributed to a taxpayer as set out in <i>Katib</i>, that should not apply here because the individual employees at Howards choose to work outside the firm’s procedures meaning that Howards was as much a victim as was the appellant, and that, in these circumstances, the failings by Howards should not be attributed to the appellant.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_23"><span class="judgment-body__number">23.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Regrettably for the appellant, we do not agree that this is a good reason. The evidence shows, as submitted by Ms Davies, that these employees simply failed to comply with office procedure. They might have done so in a significant way, and the consequences of that failure, on the appellant, might be dramatic. But it is not such rogue behaviour as to take the attribution of Howards’ failings to the appellant outside the <i>Katib</i> principle. Simply failing to comply with office procedure, in this case escalating the matters up to a director, rather than dealing with them oneself, is simply a breach of office protocol for which, we accept, an employer might be dismissed. But it is not such a frolic of their own as to enable us to say that there was such a fundamental breach of Howards’ duty to the appellant as to, effectively, mean that they were not properly acting as agent. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_24"><span class="judgment-body__number">24.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is our view that in the same way that an agent’s failings are attributed to a taxpayer, the failings by that agent’s employees are attributed to that agent. Indeed in many cases where a large firm is appointed agent, and time limits are missed it is highly likely that the failure is due to a failure by an employee.  It would not seem right to us that if, for example, KPMG were appointed agent with its huge numbers of employees, a taxpayer could say that the attribution principle does not apply because one of the employees had not complied with office procedure..  Unless the behaviour of the employee is so exceptionally egregious or vindictive that management could not be expected to police it, and it falls far outside the ambit of  behaviour expected of an employee, failures by the employee should be attributed to the employer. And the employees’ failings in this case are not in that category. The employees might have been negligent or even irresponsible, but in our view that negligence or irresponsibility must be attributed to Howards. This might sound harsh, but in our view it is up to the appellant to take this up with Howards, rather than something which exonerates the appellant from the consequences of the behaviour of Howards’ former employees.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_25"><span class="judgment-body__number">25.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In any case, this behaviour applies only in respect of periods before Howards received a copy of the bankruptcy petition. The appellant’s position as regards delays since then is that they did not understand the matters set out in the petition as there was insufficient detail in it, and despite repeated requests for clarification and detail, HMRC did not supply it. One reason for the delay, therefore, was HMRC’s failure to supply that information, and case law suggests that this is a significant factor that can be taken into account when considering the reasons for delay.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_26"><span class="judgment-body__number">26.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This is clearly a compelling point. If the appellant can clearly show that it was not possible to determine the appealable decisions from the bankruptcy petition and that HMRC had not supplied information, despite repeated repeated requests for it, to clarify the position, then that could indeed, potentially, be a good reason for the failure to make a timely appeal after receipt of the bankruptcy petition.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_27"><span class="judgment-body__number">27.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">But there is very little, if any, evidence, to support the submission that HMRC, despite repeated requests, failed to supply information which was sought by Howards. Given it is such an important point to the appellant, we would have thought that any communications between Howards and HMRC following receipt of the bankruptcy petition, would have been included in the bundle of documents provided to us. Not only was nothing supplied in the original bundle, but only two pieces of correspondence were included in the supplemental bundle which could provide such evidence. The first is Howards’ letter on 21 September 2020, the second is inTax’s letter of 16 November 2020.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_28"><span class="judgment-body__number">28.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The former  refers to two letters dated 2 July 2020 and 28 July 2020 in which Howards had asked for information about the credits which HMRC had given the appellant against his tax liabilities. But neither letter was included in the bundle. Nor were the emails which were attached to the letter of 21 September 2020 “for ease of reference”. We simply have no idea what they said, nor when they were dated.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_29"><span class="judgment-body__number">29.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As regards the latter, there is a reference to HMRC having consistently said in correspondence with Howards that the “balance of £24,835.59 was also based on a submitted return.” But there is no such correspondence in the bundle, and we simply don’t know when this correspondence between Howards and HMRC took place. We are being asked to infer that it took place between July 2018 and September 2020, but this is an inference which we are not able to make. It may simply be a reflection of the letters of 2 July 2020 and 28 July 2020 and responses to those letters.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_30"><span class="judgment-body__number">30.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As far as these are concerned, this is clearly not the “repeated requests” that, it is submitted, were made throughout the period from receipt of the bankruptcy petition in July 2018, and the instruction of inTax in September 2020.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_31"><span class="judgment-body__number">31.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We have no evidence of communications between Howards and HMRC during a period of two years between July 2018 and July 2020.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_32"><span class="judgment-body__number">32.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It was both the appellant’s and Mr Bailey’s evidence that there had been repeated requests for information.

And Mr Bailey’s recollection of the events surrounding receipt of the appealable matters, and the fact that in reviewing the files for the hearing and finding only three items, yet it was apparent from the evidence that Howards had been supplied with other documents, suggest that he did not have a particularly firm handle on the actions which Howards were undertaking on the appellant’s behalf. Furthermore, as mentioned above, Mr Bailey has not produced any of the asserted correspondence, nor indeed was the letter of 21 September 2020 put to him, so that he could explain, in more detail, the nature of the correspondence referred to in it.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_33"><span class="judgment-body__number">33.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In our view the appellant has not discharged the evidential burden to support his submission that the delay in bringing the appeal was as a result of HMRC’s failure to provide information despite repeated requests to do so following receipt of the bankruptcy petition in July 2018.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_34"><span class="judgment-body__number">34.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">More fundamental, however, is the fact that when inTax made an appeal on 28 September 2020 they had obtained no more information from HMRC than was available in the bankruptcy petition.

Yet inTax were able to do so. So why, Ms Davies asks rhetorically, were Howards not able to do so shortly after they received the bankruptcy petition. And we agree with her. As we say above, and although we were not addressed on the point, it seems to us reasonably clear that some of the significant appealable amounts were clearly set out in the bankruptcy petition.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_36"><span class="judgment-body__number">36.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Avient suggests that the appellant is in an impossible position because HMRC have not accepted that the appeal made on 28 September 2020 was necessarily a valid appeal. The logic is that therefore even if the appellant had made a protective appeal in July or August 2018, it would not necessarily have been accepted by HMRC. But it would have made it a great deal easier for the appellant to argue that he had made a timely appeal since he had made it (even if there was then a dispute about its validity) very shortly after he received notice of the extent of the appealable decisions set out in the bankruptcy petition.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_37"><span class="judgment-body__number">37.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We do accept that to the extent that the appealeable matters were not apparent from the bankruptcy petition (and only became apparent following correspondence between HMRC and inTax in the Autumn 2020 and the Spring of 2021, and subsequent directions made by the tribunal) then that is a good reason for the appeal not having been brought until details had been either supplied voluntarily by HMRC or supplied pursuant to a direction by the tribunal. But where the appealable matters were apparent from the bankruptcy petition, we do not think that the justification for the late appeal, namely that there was insufficient detail from the bankruptcy petition to enable the appellant to make an appeal, is valid. In simple terms, if inTax could do it in September 2020, Howards could have done it in August 2018.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_38"><span class="judgment-body__number">38.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">And a failure by Howards to do this must be attributed to the appellant.</p></div></section><section><p><i>Evaluation of all the circumstances</i></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_39"><span class="judgment-body__number">39.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">  We now turn to the third stage of the Martland test, namely a final evaluation of all the circumstances balancing the merits of the reasons, with the prejudice which would be caused to either party in granting or rejecting the application.

However, as was said in <i>Katib, </i>(where one of the consequences of the appellant losing his application to bring a late appeal was the loss of his house) such consequence is simply one of the results of bringing a late appeal which is avoidable if a timely appeal is brought. Suffering hardship is a common feature which could be argued by a large number of appellants.

We have dealt with this above. Whilst we appreciate the point, we do not think that failure to comply with office procedures is sufficient to displace the general rule that failure by an adviser should be attributed to a taxpayer and does not outweigh the principle that time limits should be respected.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_45"><span class="judgment-body__number">45.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The presumption is that whilst each case must be determined on its merits, permission to appeal late should not be granted. We accept that this does not depend on there being exceptional circumstances. But in light of the fact that the delay in bringing the appeal is serious and significant, and the reasons for that are not good ones, they are not outweighed by the prejudice caused by rejecting the appellant’s application.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number">46.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, as mentioned above, it is our view that this applies only in respect of the income tax matters and those VAT appealable matters which were apparent to the appellant from the bankruptcy petition. As regards the income tax appealable matters, it is clear from the correspondence that Howards had received copies of the closure notice and penalty assessment referred to in paragraph 1 of Appendix 1, and the penalty notices set out in paragraph 3 (3) of Appendix 1. As regards those VAT appealable matters which were not apparent from the bankruptcy petition, and details of which were only disclosed following inTax’s letter of 28 September 2020, we accept that notwithstanding serious and significant delays, there are good reasons for those delays (namely the appellant was not aware of those appealable matters). </p></div></section><section><p><b>DECISION</b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_47"><span class="judgment-body__number">47.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We therefore reject the appellant’s application for permission to bring a late appeal in respect of the income tax matters.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_48"><span class="judgment-body__number">48.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We also reject the appellant’s application for permission to bring a late appeal in respect of the VAT matters, save to the extent that those matters were not set out in the bankruptcy petition.
