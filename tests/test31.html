                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 19 December 2018 Mr Besim Sylaj fell to his death from the fifth floor balcony
                     of his home in Westbourne Grove in London.  Mrs Fatmire Gorani, the widow of the deceased
                     and the Claimant in these proceedings, brings this claim for judicial review, challenging
                     the conduct, findings and conclusion of the defendant, the Assistant Coroner for Inner
                     West London, (hereafter “the Coroner”) at the inquest into the death of her husband.
                     The Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, (“the NHS Trust”), which was
                     the health authority responsible for Mr Sylaj’s medical care, and Dr Samantha Sanghera,
                     a locum GP at his GP practice, are Interested Parties.
                  </p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The coroner is a judicial office holder.  The normal course for a judge or other judicial
                     office-holder facing a judicial review is to adopt a neutral stance in the proceedings
                     and to appear, if at all, not as a party to defend her decisions, but simply to offer
                     the court her assistance on matters of procedure or specialist caselaw.  By contrast,
                     the Coroner here has not only appeared by counsel to oppose the application, but has
                     submitted a witness statement in support of her case.  No objection was taken by the
                     claimant to the coroner adopting this cause. But a coroner who choses to enter the
                     arena in this way puts herself at risk of a costs order against her should the claim
                     succeed (see <i>R (Davis) (No 2) v HM Deputy Coroner for Birmingham </i>[2004] 1 WLR 2739 at [47(ii)]). 
                  </p>
               </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_3"><span class="judgment-body__number">3.</span><div>
                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I have approached the coroner’s witness statement with a little caution.  When allegations
                     of bias are made, as they are here, a court may consider the explanation of the judge
                     (or coroner); see <i>R (Pounder) v HM Deputy Coroner for the North and South Districts of Durham and Darlington</i> [2010] EWHC 328 (Admin), at [12].  But the coroner’s witness statement does not address
                     the question of bias.  Instead, she seeks to explain her reasoning and to respond
                     to the grant of permission to bring the proceedings.  A coroner’s reasoning ought
                     to be apparent from her decision.  The court would only resort to some <i>ex post facto</i> explanation if the circumstances made that essential (compare <i>R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</i> [2003] EWHC155 (Admin) at [18]).  It has not been necessary to have regard to the
                     coroner’s statement in this case.

                     that Article 2 did not apply. She summarised her reasons for that decision in a later

                     he and his family rang the SPA on 12th December 2018. The coroner responded by referring
                     to her earlier decision and to the fact that Mr Sylaj had had face to face contact
                     with a GP, after the contact with the SPA, and that that GP, Dr Sanghera, did not
                     suggest he was at risk of suicide or self harm.  But she said that she would keep

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Yet further representations were made by the family’s representatives by way of a
                     pre-action letter and a proposed claim for judicial review of her decision. It was
                     submitted that there was a system failure on the 12th December 2019 when the deceased
                     was unable to speak to a clinician at the SPA, because of a lack of an available clinician,
                     and his telephone number was not taken to ensure a clinician could ring him back.
                     It was argued that Mr Sylaj should have been viewed as especially vulnerable and at
                     risk of suicide. The submissions also highlighted the fact that, absent an Article
                     2 ruling, the family would be unrepresented at an inquest where they allege arguable
                     breaches of Article 2 right to life and that the other parties would be legally represented.

                     that there was a system failure on 12 December which constituted a breach of Mr Sylaj’s
                     Article 2 rights. As a result, on 13 September 2020, she ruled that “<i>the inquest is now an Article 2 inquest</i>”. In consequence, pursuant to s.5(2) of the 2009 Act, it was necessary for the Defendant
                     to determine not only who the deceased was, how, when and where he died, but also
                     “<i>in what circumstances</i>” Mr Sylaj came by his death.  There was no ruling that Article 2 was engaged by the
                     events of 13 December, the occasion of Mr Sylaj’s last GP appointment.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In passing, I would express some surprise that the Coroner held that any of the events
                     surrounding this death engaged Article 2 of the ECHR.  It is far from obvious why
                     the events on the 12 December 2018 engaged the state’s systems duty, even arguably.
                     The systems duty is a “<i>high level structural duty</i>” rather than an obligation of result (see <i>R (Gardner) v Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</i> [2022] EWHC 967 Admin) at [226]).  Its content and effect in the healthcare context
                     has been the subject of a consistent line of authority; (see for example <i>Powell v United Kingdom</i> (2000) 30 EHRR CD 362, at 364; <i>Savage v South Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust</i> [2009] 1 AC 681 at [45]; <i>R (Humberstone) v Legal Services Comm</i>ission [2011] 1 WLR 146; <i> (R Long) v Secretary of State for Defence</i> [2015] EWCA Civ 770, [2015] 1 WLR 5006, at [25]; <i>R (Parkinson) v HM Senior Coroner for Kent</i> [2018] EWHC 150 at [86] – [90]; <i>Fernandes De Oliveira v Portugal</i> (2019) 69 E.H.R.R. 8 at [106] and [186]-[196]) and R<i> (Boyce) v Teesside and Hartlepool Senior Coroner </i>[2022] EWHC 107 at [41].

                     this particular occasion, a circumstance that will generally <i>not </i>engage Article 2.  However, the coroner’s ruling was not challenged and is not an
                     issue before us on this application.  Accordingly, we proceed on the basis that the

                           floor I believe it was at Longland Court in West 11 sustaining fatal injuries and
                           was pronounced life extinct at the scene. Police attended and pronounced the death
                           to be nonsuspicious. No note of intent was found. The pathologist gave the cause of
                           death as multiple trauma. There was the presence of mirtazapine in his system at the
                           time of his death. No other drugs, no alcohol in his system that would have influenced
                           his behaviour or decision-making. There’s been an admitted failure by the Trust, and
                           I was very pleased the family and Mr Rule praise Ms Cox for the rapidity with which
                           they recognised what had gone wrong; the fact that they were open about what had gone
                           wrong with the family; and that they, as quickly as possible, put in a process to
                           safeguard a repeat of what went wrong.

                           would have been different if he had had a clinical triage. It’s a missed opportunity.
                           It’s possible there may have been a referral to secondary mental-health services,
                           but we know that he was seen by an experienced GP the following day who did not consider
                           he needed referral to secondary mental-health services. If he’d been triaged by a
                           clinician on the 12<sup>th</sup>, there was quite a significant range of options available between referring back
                           to the Home Treatment Team, and we know that his presentation on the 13<sup>th</sup> December, when put to Dr Lowe, he felt it would be unlikely that the referral would
                           reach the Home Treatment Team level. He could have been referred to community mental-health
                           services, a community mental-health outpatient appointment, and we’ve looked at all
                           the timelines. Without the triage, we don’t know what sort of timeline would necessarily
                           he’d have followed for an assessment He could indeed have been referred to his GP,
                           as he was when he had thoughts of self-harm and presented in a crisis to Dr Patel
                           in February and was referred to St Mary’s and assessed by liaison psychiatry at that
                           point. He was referred back to his GP.

                           by a fully qualified GP with some experience in general practice.

                           it is the usual assumption that cases of anxiety and depression are managed within
                           a primary-care setting by general practice, unless there is an elevated risk of harm
                           to self, or others, or health, and Dr Lowe explained that to us, that clearly, we
                           know how to assess a risk of harm. He was directly asked if he had any thoughts of
                           self-harm and he said no. He had never shown any disposition to be a risk of harm
                           to others. And as to a risk of health, clearly, he was presenting as anxious and low
                           mood because of a very specific matter which Dr Sanghera felt that she might be able
                           to assist with by providing him with a letter, increasing his mirtazapine and referring
                           him to psychological therapy, safety netting him, and providing him with a follow-up
                           in a very traumatic meeting.”

                           no adjustments be made to his working pattern. A disciplinary matter arose at work
                           causing him stress, anxiety and a lowering of his mood. On 12th December he rang the

                              process for which the coroner is entirely responsible. There are no parties to an
                              inquest. The rules allow various people to participate as interested persons. There
                              are no pleadings in cases whose facts might engage civil liability; and no indictment
                              in cases where criminal responsibility is suspected or clear. The inquest is not an
                              adversarial proceeding. A coroner is a judicial officer working within a statutory
                              framework. His responsibility is to discharge the statutory duty imposed upon him,
                              with a jury in appropriate cases, by conducting an investigation and inquest in accordance
                              with the 2009 Act.</span></p>

                     to the transcript of the hearing, the occasions on which, in his submission, the Coroner
                     ignored the evidence of a witness, or substituted a witness’ answer for one of her
                     own, or questioned a witness in a manner that demonstrated an appearance of bias in

                     some witnesses or against others, or otherwise.  None suggested that the coroner was
                     ignoring the evidence of any witness. None suggested she was substituting her own
                     views for those of witnesses.  When pressed, Mr Rule was left with a bald assertion
                     that the Coroner’s demeanour and tone of voice suggested these deficiencies in her
                     management of the hearing.  Despite a careful reading of the entire transcript, we
                     could detect absolutely nothing to support such a conclusion.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The coroner was obliged to approach the inquiry with an open mind, but not with an
                     empty one.  She was entitled to form preliminary views on the basis of the evidence
                     she had read and heard, and to test that against the witnesses evidence before her.
                     When the coroner put what Mr Rule called “leading questions” to witnesses, she was,
                     in our view, simply seeking to understand a witness’ evidence, to summarise it, to
                     test it or to put it in context.  There can be no complaint about a coroner conducting
                     an inquisitorial process  asking any such questions.

                     evidence with her own.  We could detect no “animus” against any witness and when we
                     asked Mr Rule for evidence of such an approach he was unable to help us.

                           We’re going to hear from the GP. We’ve heard the evidence to some extent about the

                     Similarly, at page 203, the Coroner interrupted Mr Rule and said “<i>I’m going to pause you there actually because we’ve got to bring ourselves back to
                        what Dr Patel has said on two different occasions to these transgressions</i>.” In my view, that was a proper interruption to ensure the evidence was adduced in

                        what is true and you were using those words to make sure a layperson understood the

                           has said. She said if she had thought it was severe in her consultation, face to face
                           that day, that would have been reflected in her contemporary’s medical records. The
                           fact is, it’s clear that Dr Sanghera wishes to be as helpful as possible to an individual
                           who needs some help with their employment so she may exaggerate or not necessarily
                           provide a clear description of her consultation, which, of course, is confidential
                           so I … Do take some objection about the suggestion that this doctor was willing to

                     was fairly summarising what the doctor had said and attempting to take some heat out
                     of the exchange between counsel and the witness. She was met with what was an impertinent
                     response from Mr Rule for which she was entitled to reprimand him and for which he
                     properly apologised. I detect no impropriety in the Coroner’s conduct there.

                     proper occasions for the Coroner to intervene in questioning, and I see no ground
                     for complaint either generally or in any of the examples given to us by Mr Rule. 
                     In those circumstances, I see no merit in ground 1 and, accordingly, the argument
                     that the coroner should have recused herself on those grounds also falls away.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his skeleton argument, when addressing Grounds 1 and 2, Mr Rule refers to the case
                     of <i>R (Nguyen) the Assistant Coroner of Inner West London 2021 EWHC 3354 (Admin)</i> which he says “<i>concerns the requirements for a fresh inquest found in the face of an enquiry which
                        had been conducted by the very same assistant coroner whose conduct of the instant
                        inquest is challenged</i>.” In my judgment, that was a wholly improper submission to advance. <i>Nguyen</i> has no relevance in the present proceedings. As Mr Landau properly points out, the
                     decision in <i>Nguyen</i> is neither evidence nor legal argument. It would not have been relevant even if bias
                     had been found in that case (which it had not).  Certainly, it does not provide logical
                     support for the claims advanced in the present case.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By ground 3, the Claimant submits that the Defendant failed to satisfy the State’s
                     investigative duty under Article 2 ECHR in three ways.  First, Mr Rule submits that
                     the Defendant failed to adhere to rigorous procedural fairness in conducting the inquest.

                     effective inquiry into the deceased’s death, and the role the State may have had to
                     play in it. He submits that the Coroner failed to investigate “<i>thoroughly and adequately</i>” the state’s failures to “p<i>ut in place a system and procedures to ensure to the greatest practicable extent protection
                        of individuals from risk of death in circumstances relevant to this case</i>”; to “<i>adopt necessary and reasonable preventative measures to diminish the opportunity for
                        or likelihood of suicide (or serious self-harm endangering life</i>)”;  to “<i>adopt appropriate and adequate preventive measures to secure effective protection
                        for the life of Mr Sylaj against the risk</i>”; and “<i>to take reasonable steps to provide or make available to Mr Sylaj appropriate prompt
                        support safeguarding against the risks that arose.</i>”

                     causation for an Article 2 ECHR operational breach to be found. Article 2 ECHR’s positive
                     duty requires the State to take measures to prevent, or to avert the <i>real risk</i> of, violation. Thus, the Claimant submits that the investigative duty under Article
                     2 ECHR is not only to investigate conduct which is <i>probably</i> a cause of death, but also to investigate that conduct without which there is a “<i>substantial chance</i>” or “<i>real prospect</i>” that the outcome would be different.  Thus, submits the Claimant, by failing to
                     pose and answer the question of whether the SPA’s failure to triage the deceased <i>might</i> have resulted in a different outcome (as well as whether it <i>would</i> have), the Defendant failed to sufficiently investigate the case before her, and
                     as  result, breached the investigative duty in Article 2 EHCR.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In response, Mr Landau submits that the minimum procedural requirements set out in
                     <i>Jordan v UK</i> [2003] 37 EHRR 2 were met.  The relevant fact in issue was the one which prompted
                     the Coroner to declare that this was an Article 2 inquest, namely the  alleged systems
                     failure on 12 December, and on that the Coroner made appropriate findings.  The Coroner
                     went on to investigate the consultation of the 13 December and made findings of fact
                     on that topic that were properly open to her.  The authority on which the claimant
                     relies on causation is, when properly understood, against him; there was no duty on
                     the Coroner to include in the record of inquest matters that were only possibly be
                     causative.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I turn in a moment to address the three particular criticisms advanced by Mr Rule
                     under ground 3.  But I deal first with Mr Rule’s approach to Article 2 generally.
                     Inherent in his submissions is the argument that once the coroner had declared that
                     the inquest was to be “<i>an Article 2 inquest</i>”, all aspects of the Article 2 jurisdiction were in play. I would reject that suggestion,
                     and would make the following five points. 
                  </p>
               </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_68"><span class="judgment-body__number">68.</span><div>
                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, the fact that a coroner declares that an inquest will serve to meet the state’s
                     obligation to investigate the death, and that s5(2) of the 2009 Act applies, does
                     not trigger an obligation on the coroner to investigate every aspect of the case to
                     the standards of Article 2.  The obligation imposed by s5(2) requires an investigation
                     “<i>where necessary</i>” to ensure compliance with the Convention. A coroner’s ruling as to the particular
                     issues in respect of which Article 2 requires investigation delimits the scope of
                     the Article 2 inquiry. Here, the scope of the investigation necessary to discharge
                     the Article 2 obligation – namely to determine whether there was a breach of the system
                     duty on 12 December – was never amended or challenged.  And it was on that issue that
                     the coroner properly focused her conclusions.

That latter aspect will involve a question of law, albeit in circumstances
                              which may be evolving during the course of an investigation and even at an inquest
                              itself. If&nbsp;</span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">article 2</span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">&nbsp;is engaged in this way it remains for the coroner to decide what</span><span style="color:#3D3D3D;background-color:#FFFFFF"> evidence to call at the inquest, to determine what the central issues for determination

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The effect of the Coroner’s ruling as to the application of Article 2 in this case
                     was that the statutory purposes of the inquest were expanded to include ascertaining
                     whether there was a breach of the state’s <i>system</i> duty towards those in the community with psychiatric difficulties.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Third, the significance of the ruling that Article 2 applies lies in the conclusion
                     that will be reached at the end of the inquest. The “<i>scope of the investigation and thus evidence called at the inquest is unlikely to
                        be affected by the question whether the article 2 procedural obligation applies</i>”, (<i>Maguire v HM Senior Coroner for Blackpool &amp; Fylde</i> [2020] EWCA Civ 738). The Coroner here determined that Article 2 required an investigation
                     into the alleged breach of the systems duty on 12 December 2018.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourth, the Coroner is not obliged to investigate every issue raised by an interested
                     party.  In <i>R (Allen) v HM Coroner for Inner North London</i> [2009] EWCA Civ 623 Dyson LJ, giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal said:

                              questions to be determined…The coroner was, therefore, required to do no more than

But these have little or no relevance to cases such
                     as the present, where what is in issue is the systems duty in respect of healthcare
                     in the community.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, there is no merit in the first of the claimant’s points.  <i>Jordan v UK </i>identified the minimum procedural requirements for an Article 2 inquest.  At [106]
                     – [109], the ECtHR indicated that the authorities must act of their own motion; the
                     investigation must be independent; the investigation must be effective in the sense
                     that it must be conducted in a manner that does not undermine its ability to establish
                     the relevant facts; this is, as it was described in <i>Jordan</i> "<i>an obligation of means rather than results</i>"; the investigation must be reasonably prompt; there must be a <i>''sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation or its results to secure
                        accountability in practice as well as in theory; the degree of public scrutiny required
                        may well vary from case to case''</i>: and there must be involvement of the next of kin <i>''to the extent necessary to safeguard his or her legitimate interests'</i>.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Here the state established the inquest; it was conducted by an independent coroner;
                     it was conducted in a manner which allowed the coroner to establish the relevant facts
                     – by calling and questioning the relevant witnesses and reviewing the relevant documents;

                     one which the coroner ruled required the application of s5(2), namely the alleged
                     system failure on the 12 December 2018 when the deceased was unable to speak to a
                     clinician at the SPA because of a lack of available staff, and his telephone number
                     was not taken so as to enable a clinician to ring him back.  That was addressed at
                     length in the inquest and was the subject of a conclusion in the Record of Inquest.

                     I would reject the claimant’s criticism.  As the Coroner’s summary at the end of the
                     inquest (see [34] above) illustrates, her inquiry was much broader than the events
                     of 12 December and encompassed the events on the following day.

                     under Article 2, the answer lies in the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>R (Lewis) v HM Coroner for Mid and North Shropshire</i> [2009] EWCA Civ 1403.  The Court of Appeal held that while a Coroner has the <i>power</i> to take a jury's verdict on whether a breach of Article 2 is a possible cause of
                     death questions, she is not under a <i>duty</i> to do so. This approach applies equally to inquests without juries: the Coroner need
                     only determine probable causes of death, although she may also chose to express a
                     view on other possible causes.

                     potential probable causes of the deceased’s death (namely, the SPA’s failure to triage
                     him), rather than potential possible causes (Dr Sanghera’s failure to refer the deceased
                     to psychiatric services after assessing him or to change his prescriptions). She might
                     have considered making a finding as to whether there was a<i> risk</i> that Dr Sanghera’s failure in these respects caused his death, but she was not obliged
                     to do so.  In any event, she did in fact consider the events of 13 December for their
                     potential relevance to the deceased’s death.

                     a careful and thorough review of the circumstances of Mr Sylaj’s death, complied with
                     her common law obligations and made findings on the facts that were properly open

                     into account all the relevant evidence before her.  She pointed out that the deceased
                     was unlikely to have been referred to the HTT and might well have been referred back
                     to his GP.  As she said, as it turned out, the deceased was assessed by Dr Sanghera
                     the following day.  Furthermore, it was impossible to know how long it would have
                     taken for the deceased to have been assessed for community mental-health services.
                     These were perfectly rational conclusions for the Coroner to reach on the evidence.

                     team, failures of training within the SPA and insufficiency of clinician staffing
                     levels in the SPA.  For two reasons, that argument goes nowhere.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, as Mr Landau submits, this evidence went to the issue of why the SPA failed
                     to triage the deceased, not to whether, if the deceased had been triaged by the SPA,
                     he would not have died.  Second, and more fundamentally, while the question of what
                     is a relevant consideration is a question for a reviewing court, the matter of how
                     much <i>weight</i> to apply to a relevant consideration is a matter for the decision-maker, a decision
                     with which I would decline to interfere.  The Defendant’s decision in this case –
                     that, based on the evidence before her, it was “<i>not possible to say [that] if [the deceased] had been triaged, it would have prevented
                        his death</i>” – cannot sensibly be regarded as “perverse” or “absurd”.  The Defendant’s reasoning
                     in the passage set out at [34] above is entirely cogent.

                     be at risk of deliberate self-harm and, in the light of the fact that he had a consultation

                     of Schedule 5 which imposes a requirement on the Coroner to hear submission from interested
