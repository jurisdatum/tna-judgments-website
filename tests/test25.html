                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This is an appeal to the Upper Tribunal brought by Nico 2014 Ltd (effectively by Mr
                     Armands Ozerovs who owns and runs the company and whom we shall now call “the appellant”),
                     from a decision of the Traffic Commissioner for the East of England Traffic Area (“the
                     TC”), embodied in a letter of 18 August 2021 sent by the Office of the Traffic Commissioner
                     (“OTC”) refusing to grant his application for a standard national goods vehicle operator’s
                     licence. The refusal decision was expressed to have been made due to a failure to
                     demonstrate that the requirement contained within section 13A(2)(c) of the Goods Vehicle
                     (Licensing of Operators) Act 1995 to have appropriate financial standing had been
                     met.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appeal was considered at a traditional face-to-face hearing which took place in
                     Birmingham on 25 March 2022. The appellant attended and represented himself. We are
                     grateful to him for presenting his case and answering questions which we put to him.
                     
                  </p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appellant made the licence application on 5 April 2021 with the intention of using
                     a single vehicle (authority for only one vehicle had been sought) for the purpose
                     of operating a small road haulage business. He correctly (see below) identified a
                     need to show available finance of £8,000 if his application was to succeed. He supported
                     the application with documentary evidence of finance which appeared to show funds
                     and overdraft facilities amounting to approximately £5,000 together with access to
                     credit. But the OTC found that documentation to be unsatisfactory for various reasons,
                     not least because it was not in the name of the appellant company. So, on 19 April
                     2021, the OTC wrote to ask him to provide financial evidence in the name of Nico 2014
                     Limited showing ready access to £8,000 for a period of 28 days the last date of such
                     period not being more than two months from the date of receipt of the application.
                     That request was in line with Statutory Guidance No 2 of the Senior Traffic Commissioner
                     given under section 4C of the Public Passenger Vehicles Act 1981 and which also covers
                     financial standing requirements as set out in the Goods Vehicles (Licensing of Operators)
                     Act 1995.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appellant responded by forwarding bank statements in the name of the company,
                     but the OTC did not consider such evidence to be satisfactory either. Although not
                     expressly stated, we assume (and we think it to be a safe assumption) that it was
                     because those bank statements did not evidence an average balance of £8,000 or more
                     during a 28-day period. Indeed, at some points there was a debit balance. 
                  </p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 10 June 2021, the OTC wrote to the appellant once again, in what it described as
                     a “<i>final attempt</i>” to resolve matters, notwithstanding that there was no requirement for it to do so.
                     It asked for further details regarding finance and available credit. As a separate
                     matter it also raised some queries concerning the nomination of a transport manager.
                     It then, in a follow up letter of 12 July 2021, requested a further bank statement.
                     The appellant provided further evidence which included a bank statement for the period
                     from 1 June to 16 July 2021 and which included a credit of £6,000 on 15 July 2021,
                     that sum having been provided by a company called Capital on Tap. Had it not been
                     for that payment of £6,000 the credit balance would not have exceeded £8,000 for any
                     of the period covered by the bank statements and, in fact, there were a number of
                     points at which there was either a debit balance or a negligible credit balance.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is evident from documents disclosed to the Upper Tribunal and subsequently contained
                     within the appeal bundle (so that the appellant has now had sight of them though he
                     would not have done so at the time he appealed) that there were written communications
                     in the form of internal memoranda passing between the TC and caseworkers employed
                     by the OTC concerning the question of financial compliance and other regulatory requirements.
                     Of most significance for the purposes of this appeal is a written recommendation by
                     a caseworker that the application be refused on financial standing grounds and also,
                     it seems, for other reasons linked to professional competence (the transport manager)
                     and the adequacy of arrangements for ensuring rules relating to driving hours will
                     not be breached, and a subsequent note made by a TC. The TC’s note reads “<i>The applicant has provided proof of financial standing but has not been able to show
                        the required amount over a 28 day period. The company thus far appears to be wholly
                        supported by credit facilities. Mr Ozerovs has recently completed his TM CPC but has
                        also stated he drives 55 hours per week on average which is a breech of the driver
                        Work Time Directive. He has mentioned in his explanation of how he has managed his
                        transport needs, that he runs recovery vehicles and works as a mobile mechanic. This
                        was not declared on the TM1 form. For these reasons I recommend that the</i> <i>application is refused</i>”.
                  </p>
               </div>
            </section>
            <section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_7"><span class="judgment-body__number">7.</span><div>
                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The letter of 18 August 2021, which communicated the decision to the appellant relevantly
                     indicated that the application had been refused on the basis that “<i>The financial information provided was not acceptable because you failed to establish
                        financial standing. Therefore, you failed to demonstrate that you meet the requirements
                        of Section 13A(2)(c) of the above Act</i>”. The letter offered no further explanation as to why it had been decided that the
                     financial standing requirement had not been met (no reference to the 28 day period
                     nor the perceived to be excessive reliance on credit) nor was anything said about
                     professional competence and the doubted ability to manage compliance with the regulatory
                     regime. But the letter did alert the appellant to the right of appeal. Even though
                     it might well have been the intention of the TC that refusal was to have been based
                     upon all of the concerns identified in his note, we have felt constrained to proceed
                     on the basis that the refusal was on financial grounds only since no other basis for
                     the refusal found its way into the letter communicating the decision.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appellant exercised his right of appeal. In his grounds of appeal, he asserted,
                     in effect, that taking into account credit facilities which had been made available
                     to him he had always had a sum in excess of £8,000 available. At the hearing of his
                     appeal the appellant said much the same. He added that he had other business interests
                     and would be able to move money from an account belonging to one business to another
                     where necessary. He explained that he had understood that the financial standing requirement
                     was there to ensure that an operator is able to properly repair and maintain vehicles
                     so that they can be utilised safely and he expressed the view that he would be able
                     to repair and maintain the vehicle he proposed to operate under the licence

                     which is the subject of the appeal. The Upper Tribunals jurisdiction was examined
                     by the Court of Appeal in <i>Bradley Fold Travel Ltd and Another v</i> <i>Secretary of State for Transport</i> [2010] EWCA Civ 695. It was stated therein that the Upper Tribunal has the duty,
                     on an appeal to it, to determine matters of fact and law on the basis of the material
                     which had been before the TC but without the  benefit of seeing and hearing from witnesses.
                     It was further stated that the burden lies on an appellant to show, in order to succeed
                     on appeal, that the process of reasoning and the application of the relevant law requires
                     the Upper Tribunal to take a different view to that taken by the TC.

                     August 2021 was not one in respect of which the process of reasoning and the application
                     of the relevant law <u>requires</u> (our underlining) us to take a different view. That is because whilst financial standing
                     may be demonstrated in a variety of ways (see <i>Michael Hazell (No 2)</i>: [2017] UKUT 221 (AAC)) such that an inability to demonstrate an average credit balance
                     of £8,000 over a fixed 28 day period is not, of itself, necessarily fatal, the inability
                     of the appellant do so in this case is indicative of a large degree of precariousness
                     in the company finances; because on the appellant’s own account there is a very considerable
                     degree of reliance upon credit facilities which is one of the least reliable means
                     of showing available finance (see Hazell (No 2 again); because although the appellant
                     asserted before us an ability to transfer funds from a different business to his haulage
                     business he provided no evidence of this to the TC (nor any corroborative evidence
                     to us even assuming we might have been prepared or able to consider admitting such
                     evidence) and because the overall pattern evidenced by the bank statements the appellant
                     did provide points to a business which is frequently under financed.

                     it did not set out any of the reasoning which underpinned that outcome. We make a
                     general observation, and such observations have been made by the Upper Tribunal on
                     previous occasions including in <i>Wajid Bashir t/a</i> <i>MB Travel</i> [2018] UKUT 0401 (AAC), in particular at paragraph 12 and <i>Sheraz Asghar</i> [2018] UKUT 0442 (AAC) in particular at paragraph 16, that such is not acceptable.
                     We say that because if a prospective appellant is not provided with the reasoning
                     underpinning a decision then he/she is in difficulty in making an informed decision
                     as to whether there might be merit in appealing or not. That might lead to a prospective
                     appellant appealing in circumstances where he/she might otherwise not have done (thus
                     leading to unnecessary administrative functions having to be performed) or to a prospective
                     appellant not appealing in circumstances in which he/she might have done had he realised
                     (if it be the case in any given instance) that the reasoning was at least arguably
                     defective (thus raising the possibility in some cases of a denial of justice). It
                     might lead to a prospective appellant being unable to prepare grounds of appeal which
                     are focused and properly directed towards the TC’s reasoning, thus leading to the
                     necessity for later amendment or to arguments being raised at a late stage before
                     the Upper Tribunal. None of that is satisfactory. Accordingly, we would express the
                     hope that, in relation to decisions only expressed by letter (usually the case where
                     there has been no public inquiry) the reasoning underpinning a negative decision will
                     be communicated in that letter. We would also make the point that where, as here,
                     the reasoning is evident from internal memoranda, it should be a relatively easy task
                     to transpose and incorporate that reasoning into a decision letter.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">If the above seems like harsh criticism of the OTC we do not mean it to be. We understand
                     the difficulties of working in a busy office under pressure. We understand that the
                     OTC might well still be having to cope with the fall-out from the coronavirus pandemic
                     and the huge adverse impact that has had upon administrative processes in many organisations
                     and departments. But the matter is, in our view, of such importance that not pointing
                     it out would represent a failing on our part. In this case there was no injustice
                     or unfairness because the appellant did understand why his application had been refused
                     and was able to put all of his points to the Upper Tribunal on appeal. But that does
                     not detract from the importance of the concern we have identified.
