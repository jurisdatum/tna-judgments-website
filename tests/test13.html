            </p>
            <p><br><i>(1) A decision of the Upper Tribunal to refuse permission to appeal against a decision
                  of the First-tier Tribunal disposes of proceedings in the Upper Tribunal. Except for
                  its power to set aside under rule 43 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules
                  2008 for procedural irregularity, the Upper Tribunal cannot revisit its decision.
                  As a result, it has no jurisdiction to entertain subsequently-formulated grounds of
                  challenge to the First-tier Tribunal’s decision.</i></p>
            <p><i>(2) In order to satisfy the part of CPR 54.7A(7)(a) which requires the High Court
                  to find an arguable case that the Upper Tribunal’s refusal of permission to appeal
                  was wrong in law, the court needs to be satisfied either that:</i></p>
            <p><i> (a) the Upper Tribunal’s reaction to the grounds of challenge in the application
                  for permission to appeal was arguably wrong in law; or</i></p>
            <p><i> (b) where the judicial review grounds have not found expression in the grounds considered
                  by the Upper Tribunal, the judicial review grounds are of such an a nature as to have
                  required the Upper Tribunal to have raised them of its own volition, and then considered
                  them; and that its failure to do so is arguably wrong in law.  </i></p>

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appellants are citizens of Nigeria, a mother and her son, born respectively in
                        1987 and 2015.  On 24 January 2018, they made human rights claims to the respondent.
                        On 6 June 2018, the applications were refused.  It was noted by the respondent that
                        the first appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2002, with entry clearance
                        as a visitor.  She was granted leave to remain in February 2013, on the basis of her
                        private life, until 15 August 2015.  On 11 August 2015, she was granted further leave
                        to remain, again on the basis of her private life, until 19 February 2018.  The first
                        appellant told the respondent that her husband, the father of the second appellant,
                        resided in Nigeria; and that she had family life with the second appellant, who resides
                        with her in the United Kingdom.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Given that the first appellant did not fall within the provisions of the relevant
                        immigration rules for leave to remain as a partner, her application was considered
                        by reference to the first appellant’s genuine and subsisting parental relationship
                        with the second appellant.  The second appellant, however, was not a British citizen
                        or settled in the United Kingdom; nor had he lived in the United Kingdom continuously
                        for seven years or more.  Thus, although the parental relationship was acknowledged,
                        the respondent considered that application made by reference to the child fell for
                        refusal under the rules.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The respondent found that the first appellant had not lived continuously in the UK
                        for at least the last twenty years.  She was also over the age of 18.  She was not
                        between 18 and 25 years.  This meant that the only way in which the first appellant
                        could satisfy paragraph 276ADE was by reference to sub-paragraph (1)(vi).  The respondent
                        accordingly addressed the issue of whether there would be very significant obstacles
                        to the first appellant’s integration into Nigeria.  The respondent considered there
                        would not.  The first appellant had spent her formative years living in Nigeria and
                        would be familiar with the language and culture there.  The first appellant had a
                        husband living in Nigeria, who had business interests in the country.  All of that
                        would, according to the respondent, enable the first appellant to integrate into Nigeria.
                        She had been to Nigeria since entering the United Kingdom.  For these reasons, the
                        respondent concluded that the first appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraph
                        276ADE(1)(vi).

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As for the second appellant, the respondent’s attention also focused on paragraph
                        276ADE(1)(vi).  The respondent considered that there would not be very significant
                        obstacles in the case of the second appellant because he would be relocating to Nigeria
                        with his mother and would be supported by her there whilst he integrated.  Furthermore,
                        the second appellant’s father resided in Nigeria and would also be able to supply
                        support.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The letter of refusal concluded by considering exceptional circumstances.  It was
                        noted that the second appellant was born in the United Kingdom and that the first
                        appellant was in employment there.  Although the second appellant might be currently
                        enrolled in education in the United Kingdom, it was clear to the respondent from objective
                        information that Nigeria had a functioning education system, which the second appellant
                        would be able to enter.  Although it was generally accepted that the best interests
                        of a child whose parent was facing removal from the United Kingdom were best served
                        by the child remaining with the parent, given that the first appellant would be removed
                        with the second appellant, and that the first appellant was “clearly the most important
                        person in [the second appellant’s] life … this will help him to readapt to life in
                        Nigeria”.  Although the first appellant had family and friends in the United Kingdom,
                        these ties were not considered to be strong enough to engage article 8.

                        dismissed the appeals in a decision promulgated on 8 August 2019.  The judge heard
                        evidence from the first appellant, and from the first appellant’s mother and sisters.
                        The first appellant told the judge that her marriage to her husband in Nigeria had
                        ended in June 2017.  Amongst the findings made by the judge were those at paragraph
                        17 of her decision, where it was recorded that the mother of the first appellant had
                        recently spent six months in Nigeria, looking after her own mother.  The judge found
                        that this demonstrated there was a base from which the first appellant and the second
                        appellant could begin their life in Nigeria.  At the end of paragraph 17, the judge
                        found that “the appellant’s mother is currently remitting money for some of their
                        children by bank transfer and I find she is able to assist the appellant should the
                        need arise”.

                        the second appellant by herself or through some assistance from the father of the
                        second appellant.  The decree absolute produced by the first appellant specifically
                        referred to the father paying for the school fees of the second appellant and specifically
                        stated that “it is not limited to this”.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At paragraph 20, the judge found that the first appellant was a successful independent
                        woman, who had set up her own home and educated herself and was earning a good salary
                        for an international pharmaceutical company.  At paragraph 20, he found the first
                        appellant could speak Yoruba fluently:-

                              to create an insurmountable obstacle, and in any event, the first Appellant was brought
                              up in a Remo speaking area until she came to the UK aged 15 years, and if she is a
                              little rusty, I find she can relearn it being as educated as she is having attained

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Also at paragraph 20, the judge found that the second appellant did not face any insurmountable
                        obstacles and that there were schools he could access.  He was young enough and of
                        an age when he could learn Yoruba or Remo, as well as English.

                        there were no reasons such as to compel a grant of leave by reference to that Article,
                        outside those rules.  At paragraph 23, the judge noted that the second appellant would
                        return to a network of family living in the same state as the father of the second
                        appellant “who may or may not assist with his upbringing, but even if he does not,
                        there remain some financial assistance from the grandmother and the first Appellant
                        owns an asset in the form of a house …”.  The first appellant also had “transferrable
                        skills and is able to provide for her son in Nigeria in some care related or nursing
                        related activity”.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appellants applied for permission to appeal.  The grounds of application to the
                        First-tier Tribunal contended that the judge should have realised there was a reasonable
                        contemplation that the first appellant’s private life “would not remain stagnant”.
                        This was said to be an error of law.  It was also submitted that the judge had failed
                        to recognise that the first appellant’s qualification as a qualified registered adult
                        nurse constituted an important public interest, given the shortage of nurses in the
                        United Kingdom.  The grounds further contended that there were factual errors in the
                        judge’s decision.  At paragraph 17, the judge was said to have wrongly recorded that
                        the first appellant’s mother was able to support her financially.  The first appellant
                        said that, in fact, it was the first appellant who provided financial support to her
                        mother.  It was also untrue to say that the first appellant had grown up in a Remo
                        speaking area.  The judge had misunderstood what was said at the hearing.  The language
                        spoken in her grandmother’s village was Remo, which the first appellant did not speak
                        or understand.

                        then made a renewed application for permission to the Upper Tribunal.  The renewed
                        application emphasised the alleged factual errors made by the First-tier Tribunal
                        Judge in the decision.  It was said that these impacted upon the judge’s consideration
                        of the case for the appellants.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 6 January 2020, the Upper Tribunal refused permission to appeal.  At paragraph
                        2 of the refusing judge’s decision, he noted the alleged factual errors in the decision
                        of the First-tier Tribunal.  At paragraph 3, the refusal categorised the grounds as
                        “unarguable”.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to find that the first appellant
                        was unable to satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules.  As regards paragraph
                        276ADE, the refusal noted that the First-tier Tribunal judge had found that the appellants
                        did not face “insurmountable obstacles to their integration in Nigeria”.  In reaching
                        that finding, the First-tier Tribunal Judge had had regard to the history of the first
                        appellant’s mother and found that the appellants had a base to start from in Nigeria.
                        The refusal specifically addressed the issue of whether the first appellant’s mother
                        was able to remit money to her other children in Nigeria, only because she was financially
                        supported in the United Kingdom by the first appellant.  The refusal noted that the
                        First-tier Tribunal had not found that the appellants would necessarily have to call
                        upon assistance from the first appellant’s mother.  On the contrary, the First-tier
                        Tribunal Judge had found that the first appellant was a successful independent woman
                        who had set up home and educated herself, and who was earning a good salary from an
                        international pharmaceutical company.  She could speak Yoruba and, although there
                        was a local dialect called Remo, that would not create an insurmountable obstacle.
                        The Upper Tribunal Judge considered that the assessment of an Article 8 claim “is
                        always a highly fact sensitive task”.  Reading the determination as a whole the refusal
                        of permission ended by stating that “it is quite clear that the conclusions of the
                        judge as to the Article 8 appeal were supported by reasons open to the judge on the
                        evidence before her, and the findings made”.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The appellants sought judicial review of the Upper Tribunal’s decision to refuse permission
                        to appeal.  The grounds of the judicial review application were settled by Mr Sharma.
                        He had not been involved in the proceedings up to that point.  Mr Sharma mounted a
                        criticism of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, which had not found any expression
                        in the grounds accompanying the applications for permission to appeal to the First-tier
                        Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal.  At paragraph 22 of the judicial review grounds, Mr
                        Sharma submitted that, at paragraph 17 of her decision, the First-tier Tribunal Judge
                        had misdirected herself as regards the test to be satisfied in paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi)
                        of the Rules.  The judge had described the test in terms of “insurmountable obstacles”
                        to the integration of the appellants in Nigeria, whereas paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) requires
                        consideration of whether there are “very significant obstacles to” integration.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The judicial review grounds went on to critique the First-tier Tribunal’s decision
                        on the basis that there needed to be a change in circumstances, in order to justify
                        the respondent’s refusal to grant leave to remain to the first appellant, given that
                        the latter had been given such leave on private life grounds on previous occasions.
                        The grounds submitted that the first appellant’s visit to Nigeria in 2013 could not
                        constitute such a change.  Nor could the fact that the first appellant had moved from
                        her mother’s home.  The fact that the first appellant’s mother’s had contacts in Nigeria
                        were, according to Mr Sharma’s grounds, irrelevant to the two initial grants of leave
                        and therefore not of sufficient basis on which to depart from those previous decisions.

                        in determining whether there had been a change in circumstances since the last grant
                        of leave; (ii) what approach should be taken in considering proportionality under
                        Article 8 or “very significant obstacles” under the Rules, where there has been a

                        applied to the Upper Tribunal to amend their grounds of appeal.  Accordingly, at the
                        hearing on 10 February 2021, directions were given to the appellants to explain (i)
                        what information was given to the High Court about the grounds to which the Upper
                        Tribunal’s impugned refusal of permission had in fact responded; and (ii) the basis

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The important point, however, is that those acting for the appellants at this stage
                        of the proceedings did in fact recognise the difficulty the appellants faced in bringing
                        a “Cart” judicial review, whose grounds of challenge had not previously been put to
                        the Upper Tribunal. A decision was, therefore, taken to attempt to put the newly formulated
                        grounds before the Upper Tribunal in the form of an application for permission to
                        appeal.  But the fundamental problem with this course of action was that such an application
                        had already been made by the appellants’ previous representatives.  That application
                        had been decided by the Upper Tribunal on 6 January 2020, when it refused permission
                        to appeal.  That refusal was, unarguably, a decision that disposed of the proceedings
                        in the Upper Tribunal.  Subject to what we say in paragraph 29 below, upon the making
                        of the refusal decision, the Upper Tribunal became <i>functus officio</i>.

                        power to review a decision under section 11 of the 2007 Act.  The court held:-

                              Therefore, given the terms of <b><i>section 13(1), 13(8)(c) </i></b>and <b><i>11(4)(b) </i></b>of the 2007 Act, it is also clear that a "decision" of the UT to grant permission
                              to appeal constitutes an "excluded decision".  Once an "excluded decision" is made
                              by the UT, then the UT has no power to "review" it, by virtue of the terms of <b><i>section 10(1) </i></b>of the 2007 Act.

                        review of a refusal of permission merely by making another application for permission.
                        The only way in which a decision that disposes of proceedings can be revisited by

                        43 enables the Upper Tribunal to set aside such a decision if it is in the interests
                        of justice to do so and there has been some procedural irregularity in the proceedings.
                        There is no question of there being such an irregularity in the present case.

                        consider the so-called application made on 30 January 2020, the consequences would
                        be profound.  Section 104 (Pending appeal) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum
                        Act 2002 provides that an appeal is pending during the period beginning when it is
                        instituted and ending when it is finally determined (or in other circumstances not
                        here relevant).  Section 104(2) provides that an appeal is not finally determined
                        while (inter alia) “an application for permission to appeal under section 11 … of
                        the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 could be made or is awaiting determination”.
                        If Mr Sharma is right, there would be nothing to prevent an appellant from filing
                        an unlimited number of applications for permission to appeal, within the requisite
                        time limit, all of which would have to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.

                        submissions. Construing section 3C of the Immigration Act 1971 with regard to a decision
                        of the Secretary of State on an application for leave, Richards LJ held that “once
                        a decision has been made, no variation to the application is possible since there
                        is nothing left to vary” (paragraph 35). By the same token, in the present case the
                        grounds of application for permission to appeal cannot be varied, once a decision
                        has been taken on the application that disposes of proceedings.

                        (skeleton argument, paragraph 14).  His skeleton argument continues by submitting
                        that, if the Upper Tribunal had considered the 30 January “application” (here described
                        as an “application to amend”) before the High Court’s decision to quash the refusal
                        of permission, that would have constituted an excluded decision and could have been

                        the purported application was made to the Upper Tribunal in the context of what was
                        then an undecided “Cart” judicial review cannot invest the Upper Tribunal with a jurisdiction
                        that it would otherwise lack. If the Upper Tribunal had formally responded to the
                        30 January “application” by stating that it could take no action, that decision of
                        the Upper Tribunal could be judicially reviewed or appealed, since any decision of
                        the Upper Tribunal is subject to one or the other form of challenge. But that does
                        not affect the inescapable reality that the “application” of 30 January simply could
                        have no material bearing on the High Court’s function of deciding the “Cart” judicial
                        review.  The fact that the Upper Tribunal had been belatedly approached with arguments
                        in favour of the grant of permission, which had not hitherto found expression, could
                        not relieve the appellants of the burden of persuading the High Court that the grounds
                        now advanced were such that – even though they had not been put to the Upper Tribunal
                        – they nevertheless should have occurred to it, when examining the First-tier Tribunal’s

                        Upper Tribunal should have taken the points of its own volition. That is a more challenging
                        task than under paragraph 22(a), since the basis of challenge needs to be a “Robinson”
                        obvious one (<u>R v Secretary of State for the Home Department </u><i><u>ex parte</u></i><u> Robinson</u> [1998] QB 929; [1997] Imm AR 568; <u>R (Begum) v Social Security Commissioners</u> [2002] EWHC 401 (Admin); <u>Bulale v</u> <u>Secretary of State for the Home Department</u> [2008] EWCA Civ 806; [2009] Imm AR 102).

                           <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is necessary to make one final procedural point.  If, as a result of "Cart" judicial
                              review proceedings, the grounds for contending that the First-tier Tribunal Judge
                              erred in law have changed, compared with those that were before the Upper Tribunal
                              when it made its (now quashed) decision, the appellant will need to apply to the Upper
                              Tribunal for permission to amend his or her grounds of permission, in order to be
                              able to rely upon the grounds advanced in the "Cart" judicial review.  The fact that
                              such grounds have found favour in the High Court does not mean those grounds automatically
                              become the grounds of challenge to the First-tier Tribunal's decision.”

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">What the Upper Tribunal said at paragraph 40  of <u>MA</u> cannot be used to justify what the appellants did in the present case.  As is evident,
                        the Upper Tribunal was there addressing the requirement to apply to amend the grounds
                        of application for permission, following the quashing by the High Court of the earlier
                        refusal of permission to appeal.  In the present case, the approach to the Upper Tribunal
                        on 30&nbsp;January not only took place before the High Court had made a quashing order
                        but also was apparently motivated by the view that the High Court might be persuaded
                        to grant the judicial review, precisely because the Upper Tribunal had been so approached.
                        For the reasons we have given, any such motivation was misconceived.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Having said this, we are persuaded that those acting for the appellants took the steps
                        they did in entirely good faith.  We do, however, expect that, in the light of our
                        decision in the present case, no one should repeat those steps in future.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Whether or not the High Court was influenced by the fact that the appellants had made
                        the “application” of 30 January, the outcome was that the court quashed the refusal
                        of permission to appeal.  In the light of that quashing, and of the substantive reasons
                        given for the grant of permission, the Upper Tribunal has given permission to appeal
                        against the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  The new grounds advanced by Mr Sharma
                        were, we respectfully consider, compellingly synthesised by the High Court in explaining
                        why important points of principle or practice arose.  In particular, the ground alleging
                        that the First-tier Tribunal applied the wrong test in connection with paragraph 276ADE(1(vi)
                        is of the kind which we accept the Upper Tribunal should have considered of its own
                        volition, when considering the application for permission. In the circumstances, we
                        gave permission to amend the grounds accordingly.

                        the errors in the First-tier Tribunal decision are material.  The result is that we
                        set aside the First-tier Tribunal’s decision.  Having regard to the nature and extent
                        of the fact-finding required, we remit the appeals to be heard entirely afresh by
                        the First-tier Tribunal.
