                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This is a VAT case. The respondents (or “<b>HMRC</b>”) have decided that for certain VAT periods, input VAT claimed by the appellant (alternatively
                        “<b>HFIM</b>” or “<b>the company</b>”) should not be allowed. They say this on the basis that during those periods, the
                        appellant did not carry-on a business or economic activity, nor was there any direct
                        and immediate link between the inputs and outputs during those periods. These inputs
                        include legal fees incurred by the appellant in relation to litigation conducted in
                        the Seychelles. The appellant’s position is that throughout those periods it was carrying
                        on an economic activity and that there was the necessary direct and immediate link.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This decision deals with four appeals. That numbered 2019/04048 is against a decision
                        by HMRC to disallow input tax credit for the periods 03/15 to 12/18, and a consequential
                        assessment to claw back input tax for the periods 03/15 to 06/17 in an amount of £25,120.
                        Appeal number 2020/00815 is against a decision by HMRC to disallow input tax for the
                        periods 03/19 and 06/19, and a consequential assessment for £7,896 (together with
                        interest of £50.87). Appeal number 2020/01318 is against HMRC’s decision to disallow
                        input tax for the period 09/19 in the sum of £2,665. Appeal number 2020/03154 is against
                        HMRCs decision to disallow input tax for the periods 03/20 and 06/20 in the sum of
                        £4,096.98. We refer in this appeal, unless otherwise stated, to both the assessments

                        penalty assessment covers the periods 03/15 to 12/18 and is for £9,667. The appellant’s
                        appeal against the penalty assessment is part of appeal 2019/04048.

                           which constituted an economic activity. This is clear, in their view, from the appellant's
                           grounds of appeal. The appellant, however, did not refer to either of the foregoing

                              period, it had either already made supplies for a consideration (the first question)
                              or that it had the intention of making at some time in the future supplies for a consideration
                              (the second question).&nbsp; If it is right to conclude that Norseman had not already made
                              such supplies and that it had failed to establish such intention, then it is right
                              also to conclude that it was not entitled to recover input tax. It is clear from the
                              decision in Finland that the mere receipt of payment does not, per se, mean that a
                              given activity is economic in nature: thus, payment does not per se amount to consideration.
                              What needs to be established is a direct and immediate link between the services supplied
                              and the charges levied or to be levied".</span></p>

                              appeals on the basis of the Appellant’s rights under the PVD, the domestic equivalents
                              of Articles 2 and 9 PVD in the UK are Section 5 VATA and Section 3 VATA respectively.
                              It seems to me that Section 3 VATA does not quite cover the ground laid out in Article
                              9 PVD in that it defines a “taxable person” as a person who is, or is required to
                              be, registered for VAT and therefore excludes a person who is entitled to be registered
                              for VAT pursuant to paragraphs 9 or 10 of Schedule 1 VATA but is not actually registered
                              because the Respondents fail to satisfy their obligations under those paragraphs.
                              The relevant section ought in my view to include such persons in the definition of
                              “taxable person”.  Nevertheless, nothing turns on this because it is common ground
                              that the Appellant is entitled to rely on its rights under the PVD to the extent that
                              those are inconsistent with the UK domestic legislation.  Accordingly, for the purposes
                              of this decision, I will refer almost exclusively to the relevant provisions of the
                              PVD. </span></p>

It is common ground that this decision makes it clear that the ECJ case law requires

                              for a consideration, whilst the second test relates to article 9 PVD and is satisfied

                                    activity.  It is therefore logically the first question to address.  It requires a
                                    legal relationship between the supplier and the recipient, pursuant to which there
                                    is reciprocal performance whereby the goods or services are supplied in return for
                                    the consideration provided by the recipient: see, for example, the judgment in </span><i><span style="color:#000000">Borsele</span></i><span style="color:#000000"> at [24].  That is what is meant by “a direct link” between the supply of the goods

There is no need for the consideration to be equal in value to the goods or services.
                                    It is simply the price at which the goods or services are supplied.  This requirement
                                    was satisfied in both </span><i><span style="color:#000000">Finland</span></i><span style="color:#000000"> and </span><i><span style="color:#000000">Borsele</span></i><span style="color:#000000">” </span></p>

                           services are supplied in return for the consideration, thus meaning that there is

                           the starting point in relation to this test is to note that it is distinct from the
                           first test and therefore that it is possible for a particular set of circumstances
                           to satisfy the first test - because there are supplies being made as result of a “legal
                           relationship” between the supplier and the recipient, pursuant to which there is “reciprocal
                           performance” whereby the goods or services are supplied in return for the consideration,

                           and the consideration – and yet fail the second – because the supplier does not have
                           the purpose of obtaining income from its supplies on a continuing basis.  In the words
                           of Lord Justice David Richards in <i>Wakefield</i>, “[a] supply for a consideration is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
                           an economic activity” and “[s]atisfaction of the test for a supply for consideration
                           under article 2 does not give rise to a presumption or general rule that the supply
                           constitutes an economic activity” (see paragraphs [52] and [53] in <i>Wakefield</i>)………..

                              supplies for a consideration in the future is sufficient to mean that an economic
                              activity is currently being carried on. There are a number of ECJ authorities to that
                              effect which are summarised in the Upper Tribunal decision in Norseman. I believe
                              that it is common ground that a person who incurs VAT input tax with the intention
                              of making future supplies for a consideration should both be treated as carrying on
                              an economic activity during the period in which it has that intention but has yet
                              to make the supplies in question and entitled to deduct the VAT input tax which is
                              attributable to those expected future supplies even if the expected future supplies
                              subsequently do not occur. But, insofar as that is not common ground, I consider that
                              this is the effect of ECJ decisions such as those in Belgium v Ghent Coal Terminal

                              input tax relates needs to be reflected in the prices charged by the taxable person
                              for its taxable supplies (see </span><i><span style="color:#000000">ROH </span></i><span style="color:#000000">at paragraph [17]). It said that both “cost components” and objectively determined

                           of being linked directly to any specific supply or any specific supplies. Examples
                           of this given by Lord Millett in <i>Her Majesty’s Customs and Excise Commissioners v Redrow Group plc </i>[1999] STC 161 (“<i>Redrow</i>”) were “[audit] and legal fees and the cost of the office carpet” (see <i>Redrow </i>at 169h).

                           taxable supplies or the taxable person’s exempt supplies are commonly referred to
                           in the VAT context as “overhead costs”. The input tax relating to overhead costs is
                           deductible where the costs are attributable to the taxable person’s economic activity
                           as a whole (but only in the proportion that the taxable supplies made in the course

                           economic activity) – see <i>Mayflower </i>at paragraphs [26] to [34]. The basis for the deduction in that case is that the costs
                           in question have a direct and immediate link with the taxable person’s business as
                           a whole and, as such, are “cost components of an undertaking’s products” (see <i>Cibo </i>at paragraph [33])”.

                     awards. The purpose of attendance at these events was to search for new potential
                     clients, business leads and ideas, to gather information and to develop relationships
                     with investors, hedge fund managers, third party introducers/marketers, distributors,

                     participants. In support of this, we were shown a document entitled “Enhancing Risk-Adjusted

                     of independent accountants. Those accounts appear to reflect two sources of income.
                     The first is entitled “Turnover” and reflects the anticipated income arising from
                     the Seychelles litigation. The second is “Other operating income” and reflects other
                     income for example foreign exchange gains and losses. It is for this reason that the
                     turnover of the company between 2011 and 2018, and the operating profit/loss in those
                     years, seems to fluctuate wildly. For example, for the year to 30 June 2014, its turnover
                     was £97,126 and it made an operating loss of £260,629. For the year ended 30 December
                     2018, its turnover was £30,458 yet it made an operating profit of £922,897.

                     registered in the Seychelles (“<b>HIL</b>”). In November 2010, Mr Patel discovered that the company’s business (and therefore
                     income) had been diverted by a former director of HFIL to HIL. The company started
                     litigation in the Seychelles to recover that income. In 2012 the directors of HFIM
                     Emerging Alpha Strategies Fund, the Irish fund which was party to the prospectus,
                     and which was a client of HFIM, became concerned about the potential reputational
                     consequences arising from the litigation and the amount of management time that would
                     be required to focus on it. The directors of the fund therefore resolved to temporarily
                     suspend the fund management activities with a view to recommencing them once the litigation
                     was resolved. The litigation (and therefore suspension of the fund management activities)
                     was not expected to be for long, but as a result of delays in the proceedings, resolution
                     of the litigation is ongoing.

                     were paid initially by one of his other companies, or companies related to HFIM, but

                     tax had been declared, were EC acquisitions. These were invariably of a modest nature

                     2019 invoice was accounted for in the 12/19 return. The sum of £29 was declared as

                     a number of letters to the appellant which adjusted or corrected the returns from
                     and including 09/17 to 09/20. The basis of these adjustments, which appears in each
                     of these letters, was that HMRC believed that there were inaccuracies in the returns.
                     These letters each included a table showing the boxes of those returns which contained
                     those inaccuracies, and the amounts that had been declared as well as the adjusted
                     amounts that the appellant’s return would have shown if it had not contained those

                     the following: Firstly, the trader needs to be able to show on the evidence that at
                     the time that it incurred input tax it intended to make taxable supplies (i.e. supplies
                     for a consideration which are not exempt). Secondly the trader must also show either
                     that those inputs are attributable to those expected taxable supplies (i.e. they have
                     a direct and immediate link with them) or that they are overhead costs within the
                     meaning set out in paragraphs 25 to 28 of <i>Sofology</i> recorded above.

                     and has maintained that status throughout the relevant period. It had both a commercial
                     and regulatory business plan and, as regards its fund management activities, there
                     is powerful evidence, in the form of the prospectus, to support Mr Patel’s evidence
                     that this was intended to be a significant limb of its income generating activities.
                     That prospectus is a professionally drafted document and the professional services
                     firms identified in it are all significant players in the corporate finance arena.
                     It would have taken a great deal of time, effort and cost to have concluded that prospectus,
                     and we accept Mr Patel’s evidence that it was only pulled as a result of the Seychelles
                     litigation, and the anxiety of the participants not to run any reputational risk which
                     might arise from that litigation, and that the management time needed to conduct the
                     litigation would prevent it focussing on fund management. These are all indicia of
                     a trader which has a serious intention of undertaking significant commercial activity
                     which will generate fees. It has not been suggested by HMRC that those fees might
                     be exempt as they relate to financial services (broadly speaking). And we have not
                     been addressed on the VAT status of fund management activities. But we are clearly
                     of the view that such activities were carried out with the intention of generating
                     income therefrom and it was circumstances which prevented the appellant from so doing.
                     And had it not been for the Seychelles litigation, it is our view that the appellant
                     would have undertaken its commercial activities as originally envisaged in its business
                     plan and would have recovered its input VAT in the usual way.

                     for the period in which the accounts were compiled reflecting the company’s view of
                     the actuarial likelihood of recovering such damages. As we say, we were told that
                     no invoices had been raised for these amounts yet we did see evidence that an invoice
                     had been made out to HIL dated 31 August 2017 for $42,620.29. The second source of
                     income evidenced by the accounts was, we were told, derived from foreign exchange
                     gains and losses. To our mind prosecuting the litigation during those years was a
                     commercial decision (and as things turned out justifiable one) which reflects a business
                     which, having taken legal advice, took the view that they were likely to recover significant
                     sums which, in turn, reflected work they had done in 2009, and which would also provide

                     to those introductions, along with the confidentiality agreements, the conference
                     attendances by Mr Patel and the marketing material produced for presentations. There
                     was also the oral evidence of Mr Patel as to the extent of these activities. We accept
                     this evidence as evidence of a genuine commercial activity being undertaken during
                     the period of the Seychelles litigation in order to enable the company to generate
                     income from exploiting the work done during that period once the litigation has ceased.
                     Of course, there was some exploitation during the period in question as evidenced
                     by the three invoices. But to our mind the significance of those invoices lies as
                     much in the fact that taxable supplies were made in that period as evidence of intention
                     to make such taxable supplies once the Seychelles litigation has concluded.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The evidence supplied to us demonstrates that the company was carrying on all the
                     activities that one would expect from an organisation which was intending to introduce
                     investors to fund managers and to provide financial advice to funds and to those investors.
                     And to support both activities, it undertook research through the agency of interns
                     employed by the appellant. During the conduct of the Seychelles litigation, the appellant
                     did not have the resources to fully pursue these introductory and advisory services,
                     but the research it was undertaking has enabled it to keep itself up to date with
                     the trends in the industry which is and was essential to enable it to give relevant
                     advice at the appropriate time. Furthermore, as far as introductory services are concerned,
                     it was obviously important to undertake some level of activity in order to keep its
                     name “in the market” as it were and for Mr Patel to maintain his connections which
                     could be exploited in earnest once the Seychelles litigation has concluded.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In our judgment the evidence demonstrates that the appellant was intending to make
                     taxable supplies in the future, and that intention was established at the time that
                     the input tax was incurred during the relevant periods, and we accept Mr Patel’s submissions
                     on this point.

                     or that the input tax reflected overhead costs.

                     view on this, as we only have one quarters worth of financial information, namely
                     the details of the input incurred for the period 09/17. This is unsurprising since
                     this is, as far as we are aware, the only period for which the appellant was asked
                     to provide that breakdown.

                     likely to be regular expenses such as Microsoft subscriptions and network charges.
                     It was Mr Patel’s evidence that the inputs incurred in this period were typical of
                     his inputs throughout the period covered by this appeal.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">We are reluctant to come to a conclusion on this point, and in our view the most appropriate
                     way of dealing with it is for the parties to review the inputs claimed by the appellant
                     throughout the relevant period on the basis of the finding that throughout the period
                     the appellant was an intending trader. It seems to us that the appellant and HMRC
                     should readily be able to undertake such review and to reach an agreement as to the
                     extent to which the inputs incurred during that period are either directly attributable
                     to the appellant’s intending trade or (more likely we suspect) comprise overhead costs.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There are two further matters on which we need to reach a conclusion. The first relates
                     to legal fees. We were told that these were claimed in the 03/19 and 06/19 periods.
                     There is no difficulty in identifying why these fees were incurred. They are legal
                     costs associated with the ongoing Seychelles litigation. Although, as mentioned above,
                     we were told that there was no actual invoice for the figures set out in the accounts
                     representing the accounting view of the ongoing value of a likely damages award, there
                     is the invoice dated 31 August 2017 for approximately $42,620.29 made out to HIL.
                     The four invoices for legal fees all predate that invoice. We were told that even
                     though the appellant may not have originally paid these invoices, the costs were ultimately
                     borne by it, and the four invoices were certainly all made out to the appellant. In
                     our judgment the input tax on the invoices for the legal fees has a direct and immediate
                     link to the invoice of 31 August 2017, and the appellant is therefore entitled to
                     recover that input tax.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, we turn to the question of the penalty assessment visited on the appellant
                     on the basis that it had submitted carelessly inaccurate returns for the period 03/15
                     to 12/18.  The penalty assessment explains that the appellant’s careless behaviour
                     was that it had continued to claim VAT as input tax when it has not made, nor demonstrated
                     an intention to make, any taxable supplies, and that it had failed to take reasonable
                     care in completing its VAT returns because it did not check with HMRC that this was
                     acceptable. As we have found that the appellant was, throughout the relevant period,
                     an intending trader, we take the view the appellant has not been careless as suggested
                     by HMRC, and we allow its appeal against the penalty assessment.
