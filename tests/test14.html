                        on each of two joint landlords for the offence of having control of an unlicensed

                        on them both, or none at all?  These questions arise on this appeal from a decision
                        of the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) (the FTT) by which it confirmed separate
                        financial penalties of £10,000 originally imposed on each of the two appellants, Mr
                        Gurmail Gill and Mr Jarnail S Gill, by the respondent, the Royal Borough of Greenwich.

                        On 1 October 2017 it became subject to an additional licensing scheme introduced by
                        the respondent under Part 2 of the 2004 Act.

                        was holding over under an expired tenancy granted to him by their father.  The original
                        tenancy had included a prohibition on sub-letting but, as the appellants were aware,
                        Mr Pradhan did not live at the property but instead sub-let it to the five residents.
                        He paid £1,400 a month to the appellants and collected rents totalling £1,800 a month
                        from his sub-tenants.

                        is imposed has a right of appeal to the FTT.  By paragraph 10(3) such an appeal is
                        to be a re-hearing of the local housing authority’s decision. A “re-hearing” means
                        that the FTT is required to decide for itself whether a financial penalty should be
                        imposed and, if so, to decide the amount of that penalty, rather than simply considering

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The status of being a person having control depends on being entitled to receive the
                        rack rent of the property, and section 263(2) of the Act explains that the “rack-rent”
                        means a rent which is not less than two-thirds of the full net annual value of the
                        premises.  Mr Gill suggested that, in a case involving joint landlords, there were
                        three possible interpretations of the phrase “person having control”.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">One possibility was that the person having control must be a single person, and that
                        where more than one person was entitled to receive the rack rent none of them would
                        be a person having control.  Mr Gill discounted that interpretation because he acknowledged
                        that by the application of section 6 of the Interpretation Act 1978 there could be
                        more than one person having control.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">An alternative approach might be that each of two or more landlords could individually
                        be a person having control, irrespective of the proportion of the rent which they
                        were entitled to receive.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A third approach, which Mr Gill favoured, was that two or more people could jointly
                        be persons having control.  On that basis, he suggested, only one penalty could be
                        imposed because there was only one “person having control”, albeit that that person
                        comprised two individuals.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Gill submitted that where more than one person owned property and received rent
                        from it, that fact should be taken into account when the definition of “person having
                        control” in section 263 was applied to them.  Mr Gill suggested that only a person
                        who is entitled to receive at least two-thirds of the full net annual value of the
                        premises can be a person having control and, where the rent is received by more than
                        one person, only that portion which each is entitled to receive on their own behalf
                        should be taken into account when deciding whether they have the necessary entitlement
                        to qualify as a person having control.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the evidence in this case the full value of the HMO could not be more than £1,800
                        a month, since that was the amount which the occupational tenants were paying to Mr
                        Pradhan, their immediate landlord.  Mr Gill explained that he and his brother were
                        entitled to equal shares in the property and that the rent of £1,400 a month which
                        they received from Mr Pradhan was shared equally between them.  Each of them was entitled
                        to £700 a month, which was less than two-thirds of the full value of the property.
                        It followed, Mr Gill submitted, that neither of them received the rack rent of the
                        property and that neither of them was a person having control who could commit the
                        relevant offence under section 72(1) of the 2004 Act.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Gill understood that this point had not been determined before and he suggested
                        that when deciding it the Tribunal should bear in mind the principle that a person
                        should not be penalised except under clear law (a principle which it had applied when
                        resolving a somewhat similar issue in <i>Ficcara v James</i> [2021] UKUT 38 (LC)).  The closest analogy Mr Gill’s had discovered was <i>London Corporation v Cusack-Smith </i>[1955] AC 337 in which the House of Lords had decided that where the same house was
                        let successively on a chain of leases and subleases over a period of years, more than
                        one person could be said to be in receipt of the rack rent of the house because the
                        question whether a rent was or was not a rack rent was to be determined at the time
                        of the letting.  As Mr Gill pointed out, although <i>Cusack-Smith </i>determined that<i> </i>a superior landlord and an immediate landlord could both be in receipt of a rack rent,
                        it did not address the position of joint landlords at the same level.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <i>Pollway Nominees Ltd v Croydon London Borough Council</i>  [1987] 1 AC 79 the House of Lords considered who was the person having control of
                        a block of 42 flats for the purpose of identifying the proper recipient of a notice
                        under the Housing Act 1957 requiring the person having control to carry out repairs
                        to the structure of the building.  The flats were let on long leases and the owner
                        of the freehold had covenanted to repair the structure, but it was in receipt of ground
                        rents only and it argued successfully that it was not the person having control of
                        the building because it was not in a position to grant a lease at a rack rent.  Section
                        39 of the 1957 Act was in the same terms as section 263 of the 2004 Act and included
                        the same two limbs, the first of which applied where the property was let at a rack
                        and the second where it was not so let.  In the latter case the person having control
                        was the person “who would so receive it [the rack rent] if the premises were let at
                        a rack rent”.  <i>Pollway</i> was concerned with the second limb of the definition of “person having control”.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The argument accepted by the House of Lords was identified by Lord Bridge at page
                        91 A-C, as follows:

                           <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“The argument for the respondent is that the definition is only apt to apply to a
                              person whose interest in the property entitles him to dispose of the right of occupation.
                              It is for the right of occupation that rack rents are paid. Hence the person entitled
                              to grant that right will receive the rack rent if the property is let at a rack rent
                              or would receive it if it were so let. In the case of a house comprising a multiplicity
                              of residential units let on long leases at ground rents, there is either no person
                              to whom the definition can apply or the definition applies collectively to all the
                              long leaseholders who between them either receive the rack rents of units sub-let
                              at rack rents or would receive the rack rents if the units were so sub-let.”

                        respondent’s argument that the person having control of a let block of flats was not
                        the freeholder but was, collectively, all of the leaseholders of the flats.  Lord
                        Goff agreed in the result but reached his conclusion by a different route; in doing
                        so he considered the case of a house separate parts of which were owned by different
                        people (which he acknowledged was improbable) and stated at page 97H:

                              the first limb of section 39(2) can, with the aid of the Interpretation Act 1889,
                              be read as applicable to the case where a number of persons, having interests in different
                              parts of the house which together comprise the totality of the house, join together
                              to grant a lease of the whole house at a single rack rent”.

                        (the individual flats) but it shows that there is no reason why the person having
                        control must be understood to mean one person only.  The person having control may
                        mean 42 separate individuals who have no property in common. In the commonplace and
                        more straightforward situation where two persons have a joint interest in the whole
                        of the building there is no reason why they should not collectively be persons having
                        control of the house if they are in receipt of the rack rent (or would be if the property
                        were let at a rack rent).

                        interest in the building to be entitled to receive two-thirds of its full value none
                        of the 42 leaseholders in <i>Pollway </i>would have qualified; it was enough that, acting collectively, they could have received
                        a rack rent by letting the whole of the residential parts of the building, and the
                        fact that each would have been entitled to only their share of that rent was not identified

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The true position in cases of joint ownership is much simpler than Mr Gill suggested.
                        Joint owners of the whole of the building are entitled to receive the whole of the
                        rent of the building, and it is immaterial that the terms on which they hold their
                        joint interests give each of them an entitlement, as against the other, to only a
                        proportion of the total rent.  For that reason, where there are joint landlords, any
                        one of them may give a good receipt for the rent, and on the death of one of them
                        the rent is payable in full to the survivor (see <i>Woodfall: Landlord and Tenant, </i>para 7.073).  For the purpose of section 263 both of the appellants were therefore
                        persons entitled to receive the rack rent of the HMO and both were persons having
                        control of it.

                        a single financial penalty and that the FTT was wrong to impose separate penalties
                        on him and his brother.  He suggested that where two or more persons having control
                        of an HMO fail to obtain a licence, contrary to section 72(1), section 249A, 2004
                        Act should be applied in such a way that only one joint penalty is imposed on them
                        both.  This was said to be the natural effect of section 263 and section 249A(3).

                        penalty regime under section 249A, 2004 Act, but goes also to the prosecution of criminal
                        offences which may be committed by a person having control of an HMO and to the prosecution
                        of other housing and public health offences which depend on the same definition. The
                        offence under section 72(1) is that of being “a person having control of or managing
                        an HMO which is required to be licensed … but is not so licensed”.  On the findings
                        of the FTT each of the appellants was such a person.  Each was a person having control
                        of the HMO, and each held that status while the HMO was occupied in circumstances
                        which required a licence but where none had been obtained.  The appellants did not
                        jointly commit the offence, they each committed it and each could have been separately
                        prosecuted.  In the same way, each could be the subject of a separate financial penalty
                        because each has committed his own offence.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Section 249A(3), 2004 Act provides that only one financial penalty “may be imposed
                        on a person in respect of the same conduct” (and by section 249A(9) a person’s conduct
                        may include a failure to act).  But this prohibition does not stand in the way of
                        each of two individuals being subject to a separate penalty in respect of separate
                        offences which they have each committed because each penalty is imposed on a different
                        person.  Nor is it possible to say that the conduct in each case was the same: the
                        conduct relevant to each appellant’s liability was his own conduct and not that of
                        his brother, although the things which each of them did or omitted to do was the same.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I therefore accept Mr Dewji’s explanation that the purpose of section 249A(3) is not
                        to limit the number of joint landlords on whom financial penalties can be imposed,
                        but is to prevent the same facts being used to justify the imposition of more than
                        one financial penalty on the same person.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I would add a note of caution to decision makers dealing with cases such as this.
                        In this case neither of the grounds of appeal challenged the quantum of the financial
                        penalties or raised any issue about the assessment of the appropriate penalties to
                        be imposed on joint landlords where each has committed an offence arising out of substantially
                        the same facts.  
                     </p>

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When the FTT applied the respondent’s penalty matrix in this case it did not differentiate
                        between the appellants and treated them as equally culpable for the fact that the
                        HMO was not licensed.  But it is important that the penalty imposed on each joint
                        landlord reflects his or her degree of responsibility, and a local authority or FTT
                        should give separate consideration to the conduct of each person on whom a penalty
                        is to be imposed.  There may be cases where one of two joint landlords is responsible
                        for the management of jointly owned property and where the other plays no part.  There
                        may be cases where one joint landlord has a relevant history of similar offences while
                        the other does not. The proper response to cases of that sort will depend on the facts
                        found. What is important is that the responsibilities, actions and circumstances of
                        each landlord are separately assessed.

                              law arising from this decision.&nbsp; The right of appeal may be exercised only with permission.
                              An application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal must be sent or delivered
                              to the Tribunal so that it is received within 1 month after the date on which this
                              decision is sent to the parties (unless an application for costs is made within 14
                              days of the decision being sent to the parties, in which case an application for permission
                              to appeal must be made within 1 month of the date on which the Tribunal’s decision
                              on costs is sent to the parties).&nbsp; An application for permission to appeal must identify
                              the decision of the Tribunal to which it relates, identify the alleged error or errors
                              of law in the decision, and state the result the party making the application is seeking.&nbsp;
                              If the Tribunal refuses permission to appeal a further application may then be made
                              to the Court of Appeal for permission.
