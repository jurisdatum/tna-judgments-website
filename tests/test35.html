                     unpaid. That was a sum deferred in the period 1 to 31 March 2020. HMRC went on to

                     in either the claim form or particulars of claim. The only mention of such an argument,
                     prior to the exchange of skeleton arguments, was in a short paragraph in the evidence
                     of Emlyn Hudson dated 7 December 2021, served in reply on behalf of Euler. On seeing

                     Under rule 8.2 of the Civil Proedure Rules, in a Part 8 claim such as this, the claimant
                     must state in the claim form what question the claimant wants the court to try or
                     the remedy which the claimant is seeking and the legal basis for the claim to that
                     remedy. The claim form here did not refer to any question of whether restitution was
                     available nor did it refer to a restitutionary remedy or to the 1856 legislation,
                     mentioned above, as the basis for it. In these circumstances, it is not open to Euler
                     to rely on this alternative basis of claim without seeking to amend its claim form.
                     No such application to amend has been made.

                     under the Guarantee as from 30 June 2020, the demand for payment of HMRC sent on 8

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <u>Hardman</u> the court was concerned with a guarantee under which the guarantor was liable to
                     pay on demand but which was determinable on three months notice. It was common ground
                     that no cause of action arose against the guarantor until a demand was made. It was
                     also the case that the termination provision stated ‘<i>This guarantee shall be a continuing security and shall remain in force …until determined
                        by three months’ notice in writing”. </i>The relevant guarantee also expressly provided for what was to be preserved from the
                     effect of termination: “<i>…[B]ut such determination shall not affect the liability of the guarantor for the
                        amount due hereunder at the date of expiration of the notice with interest as herein
                        provided until payment in full”. </i>The Court of Appeal placed reliance on this express wording in concluding that there
                     could be no continuing exposure to contingent debts after termination had taken effect.
                     Unless demand had been made at the date of termination there was nothing due that
                     could be the subject of continuing liability. The court also took account of the commercial
                     consideration of the guarantor remaining contingently liable without limitation of
                     time, with demand potentially being made many years later and proceedings being issued
                     6 years after the demand.

                     in contrast to the Guarantee in this case, there was express provision for the nature
                     of the liability that was to persist after termination. In <u>Hardman</u> that express wording required a demand to have been made for any exposure to persist.
                     There is no such equivalent wording in this case.

                              which identifies an obligation of the principal and simply states that the surety
                              guarantees that that obligation will be discharged. The subject matter of the guarantee
                              is thus the payment of an identified debt or the discharge of the principal's liability
                              in respect of an identified transaction. The liability of the surety is not, as such,
                              qualified in amount or time; a further term is necessary to do that. The liability
                              of the surety to the creditor accrues and becomes actionable as soon as there is a
                              default by the principal. Any repayments by the principal will reduce or extinguish
                              the obligation the subject of the guarantee and therefore the liability of the surety.
                              If there is a running account, prima facie, the rule in </i><i><u>Clayton's Case</u></i><i> (1816) 1 Mer 572 will apply ( </i><i><u>Re Quest CAE</u></i><i> (1985) 1 BCC 99 , 389 at pp. 99,392–99,393). The liability of the surety is exhausted
                              once the relevant obligation has been performed and does not cover further advances.</i></p>

                              monetary obligations) of the principal to the bank at any given time. It is in essence
                              a security with a floating subject matter. Ordinarily such a guarantee will not prudently

                              that the obligation of the surety arises when a demand is made upon him by the creditor.
                              That demand provides the moment at which a line is drawn under the account between

                              some mechanism whereby he can bring this state of affairs to an end. Commercially,
                              there is more than one way in which he can do this. One is by including in the guarantee
                              a provision which enables the surety to give notice of termination of the guarantee
                              contract so that the creditor is given a period of time within which he may if he
                              chooses make a demand upon the surety; if he does not do so, the contract then wholly
                              comes to an end. This was held to be the effect of the guarantee in the </i><i><u>Hardman</u></i><i> case. Another is by having a provision which enables the surety by the service of
                              a notice to bring to an end the continuing character of the guarantee so that from
                              the expiry of the notice its subject matter becomes the obligations of the principal
                              to the creditor at that time. The judge has held that this is the effect of cl. 3

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In <u>Simjee</u> the Court of Appeal concluded that the guarantee in issue was a continuing guarantee
                     falling into the second category of the type described in the judgment of Hobhouse
                     LJ and it was the continuing nature of the guarantee that was determined by notice.
                     Liability remained in respect of contingent liabilities in existence as at that date,
                     the notice effectively crystalised their extent. In that case the court was able to
                     rely on express wording referring to the guarantee being determined and “the liability
                     hereunder crystallised”.

                     reference to liability being crystallised after notice of termination. In this case
                     the central question is what is meant by the term “liability” as used in the proviso
                     to the termination provisions in clause 4 which provide for liability to cease “except
                     for any liability arising hereunder before that date”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment construction of the term “liability” is informed by other provisions
                     of the Guarantee such as that setting a limitation on liability in clause 3 and the
                     additional provisions regarding deferred sums that were unpaid during the continuance
                     of earlier guarantees. Such provisions strongly support the conclusion that “liability”
                     encompasses contingent liability in respect of sums regarding which payment has been
                     deferred and which could be the subject of a demand by HMRC if not paid by MSL.  Thus,
                     for example, clause 3(b) states that the overall liability of Euler is subject to
                     a proviso that the advice of any default in payment has been received by HMRC’s bank
                     not later than 7 days after default occurred. The “overall liability” figure may thus
                     increase because of a delay in bank notification which suggests “liability” is concerned
                     with exposoure to a potential demand by HMRC as a result of such bank notification
                     of default.  See also the provisions of clause 6 which also provide for Euler’s “overall
                     liability” to be increased in respect of sums deferred and not yet paid and which
                     therefore amount to a contingent or potential liability for a gurantor.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Defendants rely (as the guarantor did in <u>Hardman</u>) upon the possible length of time that Euler might be exposed to a demand under the
                     Guarantee under such a construction. But such a commercial consideration is not in
                     any way decisive – it did not deter the Court of Appeal from reaching its conclusion
                     in <u>Simjee</u>.  Moreover, in this instance we are concerned with the deferral of the payment of
                     taxes for which there is a statutory framework and obligation to collect. It would
                     therefore seem unrealistic to conclude that a default by MSL, for example by its bank
                     failing to meet a direct debit, would not result in a demand within a relatively short
                     timescale by HMRC under the Guarantee, as has in fact happened.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By contrast the Defendants’ construction could well have uncommercial results. HMRC
                     could afford more than a 7 days period of deferral (from the time periods referred
                     to in the letter of demand it would appear 15 days deferral was in fact afforded to
                     MSL). If the exposure of Euler could end within 7 days save in respect of sums demanded
                     then HMRC might arguably have no recourse to the guarantor for sums for which payment
                     was deferred during its validity but which had not yet fallen due. This would mean
                     that in cases where this standard form of guarantee was used HMRC could only safely
                     allow 7 days as a period of deferral. That would be an odd conclusion given that relevant
                     statutory provisions governing deferral of payment to HMRC at the time envisaged longer
                     periods of deferral (see the Customs Duties (Deferred Payment) Regulations 1976 SI
                     1976 1223, the Customs Duties (Deferred Payment) (Amendment) Regualtions 1978 SI 1978
                     No.1725 and Excise Duties (Deferred Payment) Regulations 1992 SI 1992 No.3152,  and

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Having regard to the above, in my judgment, the demand made by HMRC on 8 September
                     2020 was not affected by the prior termination notice. As I understand it there is
                     no other ground on which it is contended that the demand was invalid. I also understand
                     there to be no question over the sum paid by Euler to HMRC being recoverable in these
                     circumstances from the Defendants under the terms of the Indemnity.

                     that they were properly payable under the Guarantee. However, even if I had not decided
                     that the demand of HMRC under the Guarantee was valid I would still have concluded

                     by the Defendants) there remain the provisions in clause 6 of the Indemnity to consider.
                     Under  clause 6 a demand in writing is to constitute conclusive evidence of the fact
