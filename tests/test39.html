Four months later, the defendant pleaded guilty, so the trial did not go ahead. Costs Judge Rowley decided that the case qualified for a cracked trial fee, saying (at paragraph 8 of his judgment):</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“The Legal Aid Agency’s Crown Court Fee Guidance accurately describes the essence of a cracked trial as being that after the PTPH there is still the real possibility of a trial. The express way of this occurring is of course for the defendant to plead not guilty.
