                     as long ago as 2012.  Since then there have been two substantive hearings in the Divisional
                     Court (in 2014 (Rafferty LJ and Underhill LJ) and 2015 (Aikens LJ and Nicol J), reported
                     at [2014] EWHC 2372 (Admin) and [2015] EWHC 547 (Admin) respectively), and one application
                     to re-open the appeal in 2019, which was refused on the papers by Nicol J.    This
                     is therefore the second application to re-open the extradition appeal.

                     and settled under a false identity. She was arrested at her home in Sussex on 15 May

                     five European arrest warrants (EAWs) issued by the Greek judicial authorities (being
                     the public prosecutors in Athens and Piraeus).  EAWs 1-4  related to alleged misconduct
                     in the Applicant’s role as a judge, for which she was sentenced in her absence to
                     varying terms of imprisonment. EAW5 contained accusation and conviction elements,
                     relating to a series of offences over the period 2000–2004, in which the Applicant
                     was said to have corruptly abused her position as a judge and otherwise acted improperly.

                     to the judgment, the four conviction EAWs were withdrawn and the order of the district
                     judge in relation to those EAWs was quashed. That left the Court to consider the Applicant’s

                     in that warrant on the ground that they were not extradition offences under s 10 and
                     s 65 of the Extradition Act 2003 (EA 2003). The Court dismissed all the remaining
                     grounds of appeal, save for two, which were left undecided: (a) whether the conditions
                     in the prison in which the Applicant would be detained were so poor/overcrowded that
                     extradition would be contrary to her rights under Article 3 of the European Convention
                     on Human Rights (ECHR); and (b) whether (in relation to the conviction part of EAW
                     5) extradition would constitute a disproportionate interference with the Applicant’s
                     rights under Article 8 of the ECHR, having regard to the short sentence of imprisonment
                     (24 days) to which the Applicant would be subject for the conviction offences following
                     the ‘falling away’ of a number of offences and having regard to other periods which
                     served to be deducted from the original sentence (see at [38] and the Second Judgment,
                     [7]).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the Second Judgment, on 6 March 2015, Aikens LJ and Nicol J gave judgment on the
                     remaining issues, having heard live expert evidence and full argument on Article 3
                     ECHR. The Court was satisfied that there were no substantial grounds for concluding
                     that there was a real risk that the Applicant’s Article 3 ECHR rights would be infringed.
                     That was principally because there was an assurance from Greece that if she were to
                     be extradited, she would be detained in the New Branch of the Independent Women's
                     Prison Establishment at Korydallos.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to Article 8 ECHCR, the Court noted that ‘there is no family life to consider nor
                     are there any interests of minor children to take into account’ ([73]-[76]). The appeal
                     was therefore dismissed on both grounds.

                     in the extradition process which, even then, had occurred.   I need not point out
                     that one of the principal purposes of the EAW scheme was to reduce the delays which
                     had bedevilled previous extradition regimes, even in relation to EU states which are
                     also signatories to the ECHR (like Greece).

                     then having ended), but she failed to attend the agreed meeting point with Sussex
                     Police. When contacted by police officers, the Applicant claimed that she was sick,
                     unable to travel and that she had obtained a sick note from her doctor.  There were
                     then proceedings in the magistrates’ court about whether she was too ill to travel.
                     Her claim was apparently not backed up by her doctor, who had refused to sign a sick
                     note to that effect. The district judge said he could not be certain of the position,
                     but gave a strong warning to the Applicant that there should be no further sick notes
                     or attempts to avoid extradition.

                     for judicial review of the decision to extradite her (this was refused) and, as I
                     understand it, she made an application to re-open the immigration proceedings.

                     That application was advanced on the basis that a new Greek Penal Code had come into
                     force on 1 July 2019, changing the conduct for which her extradition was sought (on
                     the accusation part of EAW 5) from ‘felony’ offences to ‘misdemeanour’ offences. She
                     submitted that this reform rendered the offences time barred, such that she could
                     no longer be prosecuted for those offences. In the circumstances, she submitted that
                     it would be disproportionate to extradite her to serve 24 or so days on the conviction
                     matter.

                     and was supported by Further Information (FI). The FI confirmed that the introduction
                     of the new Penal Code; however, the Penal Code had only partial effect on the conduct
                     contained in the EAW. All but one of the accusation offences were now time barred,
                     having been transformed into ‘misdemeanours’. However, the Applicant could still be
                     prosecuted for the one offence unaffected by the changes, the offence of money laundering.
                     As to the conviction matter of (originally) 80 months, whilst this was also impacted
                     by the new Penal Code, it did not become time barred until 12 November 2019. At the
                     time of the application, therefore, the Applicant still had to serve the remaining
                     24 days of that sentence and would be liable to serve any sentence on the one outstanding
                     accusation matter in the event she were convicted of it.

                     event, he did not consider that the impact of the new Penal Code amounted to ‘real
                     injustice’ or <i>‘</i>exceptional circumstances’ within the meaning of Crim PR r 50.27.

                     two principal bases on which he said the appeal should be re-opened: (a) the fact
                     that, as he submitted, the Applicant had now been convicted in her absence.  He said
                     this was unfair, and a breach of Article 6 of the ECHR.  He also relied on s 20 of
                     the EA 2003.   He also said there had been an abuse of process because the Greek authorities
                     had not notified the English authorities (presumably the CPS) of this development;
                     and (b) he also relied on expert evidence concerning prison conditions and said it
                     showed a real risk of a violation of Article 3 through overcrowding, including at
                     the prison where the assurance indicated the Applicant would be detained if extradited.
                     Other points made in writing (but not substantively developed orally in any depth)

                     establish any risk of an Article 3 violation, and in any event the very high threshold

                     or sparingly, exercised: <i>Taylor v HMP Wandsworth and others</i> [2009] EWHC 1020 (Admin), [30]. There needs to be ‘truly exceptional circumstances’:

                           extradition treaties, as well as there being an equally high importance in the finality
                           of litigation. Finality of litigation is particularly important in extradition cases:
                           ‘because of the public interest in an efficient process, the need to adhere to international
                           obligations and to avoid a recurrence of the delays which have so disfigured the extradition
                           process in the past and to which successive appeals over time can subject it’.”

                     original extradition hearing, the district judge held that the Applicant’s evidence
                     displayed ‘a high degree of manipulation’, also refusing to accept that she had ‘a
                     rational fear of reprisal from Greek Government, judicial or business interests’.
                     Those findings were recorded in the First Judgment (at [78]). The Court was unpersuaded
                     by the Applicant’s case on extraneous considerations, saying, ‘there is nothing about
                     the terms of the charges themselves, or the subsequent history of the proceedings,
                     that suggests a political motivation on the part of the prosecutor or that the charges
                     have been fabricated’ (at [77])<i>; </i>and as to fair trial rights: <i>‘</i>[t]here is no reliable evidence that the Court of Appeal in Athens will not hear the
                     Appellant's case fairly and impartially’<i> </i>([80]).   There was also the Applicant’s failed attempt to persuade a doctor to provide

                     on the correct basis. Further, the remedy, a residual abuse of process jurisdiction,
                     only arises where ‘the error or omission is material to the operation of the statutory
                     scheme’. The Applicant has not demonstrated any such materiality. When she was convicted

                     reflects the fact that the prosecuting agencies have shown a lack of urgency in bringing
                     the requested person to justice (cf. <i>H(H) H(H) v Italy</i> <i>Deputy Prosecutor of the Italian Republic, Genoa</i> [2013] 1 AC 338; at [46] <i>per </i>Lady Hale and [91] <i>per </i>Lord Hope). That is clearly not on all fours with the case like the present, where

                     to the workings of the asylum process at the instigation of the Applicant.

                     oppression under s 25 of the EA 2003 so as to prevent or delay extradition.    It
                     is to be presumed that Greece will be able to provide her with any medical treatment
                     she requires, and I am sure that her resourceful lawyers will ensure that her medical
                     records go with her to Greece.

                     raised.  She has once already unsuccessfully attempted to avail herself of the Court’s
                     jurisdiction to reopen. Even where elements of her application relate to more recent
                     developments (for example, her conviction in absence in 2020), it is notable that
                     she has waited until the likely exhaustion of her asylum claim to challenge the outcome
                     of her extradition proceedings.   I note what Ouseley J said about the interplay between
                     extradition and asylum in <i>R (Troitino) v National Crime Agency </i>[2017] EWHC 931 (Admin):

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Any contention by a claimant that a document or action rejected by the SSHD as constituting
                           an asylum claim must be tested and resolved swiftly, if there is an extradition background
                           and not left to languish in uncertainty in the appeal process, whether for tactical
                           purposes or not. The Magistrate’' Court and Divisional Court must be kept fully informed
                           as to the precise position with any actual or purported asylum claim. The human rights
                           bars in ss21 and 21A, and the extraneous consideration bar in s13 of the 2003 Act
                           should be fully presented and resolved in the extradition proceedings. They should
                           not be reserved for any asylum claim nor should the extradition proceedings be adjourned
                           to await the outcome of the asylum proceedings, unless very good reason to the contrary
                           is shown.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The extradition courts and the FtT and UTIAC should be astute to prevent any abuse
                           of their procedures. Where the human rights issues have been resolved in the extradition
                           proceedings, or where no bars were raised, it is difficult to see on what basis those
                           issues should be reconsidered, let alone determined differently, in FtT or UTIAC proceedings,
                           or why, if the human rights basis for an asylum claim has been disposed of in extradition
                           proceedings, the empty husk of an asylum claim should not be disposed of rapidly by
                           the Tribunal [emphasis added].”

                     to frustrate the extradition order made a decade ago.   It comes nowhere near meeting
                     the necessary high threshold. This application is accordingly refused.
