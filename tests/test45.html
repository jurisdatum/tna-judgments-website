                     time, and is therefore prima facie invalidated by s.245 of the Insolvency Act 1986
                     (“<b>The Act</b>”). However, that section provides that such a charge is not invalidated if consideration
                     is given for it at the time of or after its creation.

                     this regard – the issue is simply whether, as a matter of law, his interactions with
                     the Company constituted the giving of good consideration at the same time as or after
                     the creation of the Charge so as to validate it.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Bitumina International DMCC (“<b>DMCC</b>”) was a company established in Dubai on 10 April 2019. It was owned by the Second
                     Respondent, Mr Farah. Its main (and apparently only) asset appears to have been a
                     cash balance of $2,350,000. On 22 November 2019, Mr Farah entered into a sale and
                     purchase agreement (the “<b>SPA</b>”) to sell DMCC to the Company in consideration of the issue by the company to him
                     of 2,332,750 convertible secured loan notes of $1 each (the “<b>Notes</b>”). The security for the Notes was to be constituted through a separately executed
                     debenture granting a floating charge over the assets of the Company. The terms of
                     the Notes were recorded in a document called the Convertible Loan Note Instrument
                     (“<b>CLNI</b>”).

                     within the prescribed period, and therefore became ineffective against the Joint Administrators
                     at the expiry of that period.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The completion process of the SPA was protracted, since the UAE company law formalities
                     relating to the transfer of the shares in DMCC took time to complete. Since the SPA
                     had provided for completion to take place “immediately”, both parties were now in
                     breach – the Company because it had not granted a valid  Debenture, and Mr Farah because
                     he had not transferred the shares. During this period, the parties to the SPA clearly
                     agreed to vary its terms to require the creation of another Debenture. A second debenture
                     was created (the “<b>Second Debenture</b>”), which was invalid on its face. However, nothing turns on that document.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It was therefore agreed between the parties that another Debenture (the “<b>Third Debenture</b>”) should be executed on the same day that the share transfer was to be completed.
                     This was 22 January 2020.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Third Debenture was formally invalid for two reasons. First, Mr Farah was both
                     a party to it and witnessed the signatures of Mr Schmidt and Mr Hamoud (<i>Seal v Claridge</i> (1881) 7 QBD 516 at 519); and second, that the execution pages were not in fact executed,
                     but the execution page of the Second Debenture was attached to it (<i>R (On the application of Mercury Tax Group) &amp; Another v HMRC</i>  [2008] EWHC 2721 (Admin)). It therefore  never took effect as a deed. It was, however,
                     registered with the registrar of companies as a charge.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is not legally necessary for a floating charge to be granted in the form of a deed.
                     Where parties bind themselves to create a charge,  purport to do it by deed, and the
                     deed itself fails, the question becomes simply one of whether the steps taken by the
                     parties, disregarding the deed, were sufficient to create a legally enforceable obligation
                     on the chargor to apply the charged property in discharge of the secured obligation.
                     It is common ground between the parties that that was the case here. A valid equitable
                     charge (the “<b>Charge</b>”) therefore came into existence at this time.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Shortly after the completion of the SPA, the terms of the agreement between the parties
                     were significantly renegotiated. This renegotiation involved amendments to the terms
                     of the Notes recorded in the CLNI, and these amendments were effected by the execution
                     of a deed of amendment dated 23 April 2020 (the “<b>Deed of Amendment</b>”). The question of whether the effect of the Deed of Amendment was in fact to cancel
                     the existing Notes and replace them with new instruments is a significant point in
                     this application.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It should be noted that the Charge was in the form of an “all monies” debenture –
                     thus the amendments effected by the Deed of Amendment did not require any amendment
                     to the Charge, and would not have done so even if they had constituted the extinction
                     of the existing Notes and the creation of new instruments.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Brockman, for Mr Farah, says that the restructuring of arrangements between the
                     parties went some way beyond the specific measures recorded in the Deed of Amendment,
                     and that in analysing the position I should look at the entire agreement between the
                     parties, and not merely the terms of the Deed of Amendment. I accept that submission.
                     I will therefore refer to the entirety of the restructuring of the arrangements between
                     the parties as the “<b>Renegotiation</b>”.

                     is given at the same time as, or after, the granting of the charge. However, words

                     that he has given consideration, the beneficiary of the charge must show that he has
                     either provided “money paid, or goods or services supplied” to the company granting
                     the charge, or has procured a discharge or reduction of a debt of the company.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is also important to bear in mind the legal nature of a charge. In Bridge et al,
                     <i>The Law of Personal Property</i> (3rd ed. 2022), the following summary is given at para 16-068:-
                  </p>
                  <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>
                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“When a charge is created, the debtor (the “chargor”) simply agrees with the creditor
                           (the “chargee”) that certain assets (the “charged assets”) are to be appropriated
                           to the discharge of a debt or other obligation. It is in the nature of a charge that
                           it be made for consideration. If the security agreement is between debtor and creditor,
                           there is inevitably consideration, but charges are not limited to agreements between
                           these parties. What is critical is the existence of a specifically enforceable agreement
                           creating the charge. This is because the existence of the equitable proprietary right
                           relies on the chargee having a specifically enforceable right to have the charged
                           property appropriated to the payment of the relevant debt or discharge of some other
                           obligation. As Briggs J put it in <i>Re Lehman Bros International (Europe) Ltd</i>: “It is that right of specific enforcement which transforms what might have otherwise
                           been a purely personal right into a species of proprietary interest in the charged
                           property” ([2012] EWHC 2997)”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Because a charge arises out of an enforceable personal obligation, “an unconditional
                     promise to create a charge in the future in equity creates a charge immediately since
                     equity looks on as done that which ought to be done. This again is subject to the
                     proviso that valuable consideration has been given in return for the promise”; <i>Levy v Abercorris Slate &amp; Slab Co</i> (1887) 37 Ch D 260, at 265. It is therefore clear that any enforceable agreement
                     (generally, an agreement for good consideration to grant a charge) is effective to
                     create that charge in equity.

                           seem to me that it must be registered under s. 14 of the Act of 1900, otherwise it
                           is void as against the liquidator and any creditor of the company. Or it may be so
                           expressed as to be merely an agreement that in some future circumstances a security
                           shall in the future be created. In that latter case, the agreement not creating a

               <p><b>The DMCC Transaction</b></p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The DMCC transaction was not a conventional corporate sale and purchase, and it is
                     important to understand its economic reality. The sole asset of DMCC was its cash
                     balance – in effect the Company was buying a box containing $2.3m in exchange for
                     the issue of $2.3m of Notes. However, by buying the box, the Company did not obtain
                     unrestricted access to its contents. Mr Farah controlled the bank account within which
                     the $2.3m was held, and the Company could only access that money with Mr Farah’s active
                     co-operation. Mr Farah allowed the use of the money to finance bitumen trading transactions,
                     but for no other purpose.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Farah’s evidence is that the intention at this stage was that the Company would
                     shortly raise new finance from external finance providers. At that point the Notes
                     would be paid off and the Company would gain unrestricted access to DMCC’s cash balances.
                     The transaction was therefore intended to be in the nature of a bridging loan.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The management of the Company, personified by Mr. Berndt Schmidt, seems to have been
                     considerably more interested in the acquisition of more bitumen companies than in
                     raising new finance. In particular, he was seeking to acquire Stratura Asfaltos (a
                     Brazilian Asphalt company) <b>(“Stratura”) </b>and Nynas NB, a Swedish refinery company <b>(“Nynas”) </b>from Neste. This caused the Noteholders a great degree of concern, to the extent that
                     they almost called in the Notes. As a result, negotiations took place to reach a new
                     agreement.  The changes to the terms of the Notes were effected by the Deed of Amendment.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The drafting of the Deed of Amendment and accompanying resolutions was carried out
                     by Curtis, a firm of lawyers based in London. A key point here is that the form which
                     the Notes took was that of registered notes whose existence is evidenced by certificates
                     issued under seal by the Company. Curtis are said to have been concerned that the
                     changes to the CSNI being made by the Deed of Amendment were so fundamental that they
                     amounted to the cancellation of the existing Notes and the issue of new Notes. That
                     led to the inclusion  in the Deed of Amendment of provisions requiring that the original
                     Certificates dated 22 November 2019 be delivered up to the Company, and that they
                     be replaced by new Certificates with new numbers issued on 23 April 2020 (the “<b>Note Exchange</b>”). The old Certificates were to be destroyed by the Company, and the replacement
                     Certificates were to be reflected and recorded in the register of the Notes.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The benefit to the Company of the Renegotiation was twofold. By extending the maturity
                     of the Notes from one year to two, it gained more time to raise external capital.
                     Also, and importantly, Mr Farah agreed that the cash held in DMCC could be deployed
                     elsewhere within the group. This was a somewhat limited concession, since the cash
                     remained subject to the control of Mr Farah and could only be deployed with the consent
                     of Noteholders. However, USD $1,726,849.80 of DMCC’s cash was deployed after  23 April
                     2020.

                     in any event, and the other being that, even if they did, the charge was in fact created

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The SPA imposed an unconditional contractual obligation on the Company to create a
                     charge. It is very common for a contract to impose an unconditional obligation to
                     create a charge by deed, but for the deed itself to be executed some time after the
                     contract is entered into. The legal position where this is done is relatively well
                     understood – the execution of the valid deed of charge vacates the obligations created
                     by the original contractual charge. Gough on Company Charges (2nd ed)  suggests that
                     this is because the contractual charge is extinguished through merger (pp 711-2) (see
                     <i>Re Tyrrels Ltd</i> [1929] SASR 450), and I agree.

                     of two co-existent charges. In <i>Re Gregory Love &amp; Co</i> [1916] 1 Ch. 203, there was an agreement to charge, which was registered, and a subsequent
                     deed, which was also registered. The latter was given within the vulnerable period.
                     Sargant J held that the prior agreement, although duly registered, could not save
                     the subsequent security, as the subsequent formal charge was to complete an execution
                     or performance of the prior agreement as to leave no right or obligation still subsisting
                     under it (at p.211). The effect of the instrument, as Cozens-Hardy M.R. said in <i>Re Columbian Fireproofing</i> [1910] 2 Ch. 120 at 123, is that "the formal instrument necessarily supersedes and
                     gives the go-by to the prior agreement”.

                     time. As a result, I think it is correct to say that the initial contractual charge
                     continued in existence. However, since it was not registered, it was void against
                     a liquidator, administrator or creditor, and was therefore useless for all practical
                     purposes.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After the failure of the First Deed to create a valid charge, the position was that
                     the Company was subject to an unperformed contractual obligation to create a valid
                     floating charge. I think it is clear that the failed creation of the first deed did
                     not discharge that obligation - where a person contracts do something, and attempts
                     unsuccessfully to do it, it is clearly not the case that the failed attempt at performance
                     discharges the contractual obligation to perform. The Company here, having contracted
                     to give a valid floating charge and failed to do so, was under a continuing obligation
                     to perform that obligation. That obligation did not itself create a charge, since
                     it was  “merely an agreement that in some future circumstances a security shall in
                     the future be created” (<i>Jackson &amp; Bassford Ltd </i>[1906] 2 Ch 467). However, the only way in which the parties could perform their contractual
                     obligations was to agree a new date on which to grant a new charge, since there was
                     nothing that the parties could do to validate the original charge (the date for registration
                     having passed).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems to me to be clear from the facts that at some point the Company and Mr Farah
                     must have agreed that the new charge was to be created on a specified date, and that
                     date was to be 22 January 2020. On that date a new charge was to be granted, a new
                     deed was to be executed, the new charge was to merge into that new deed, and that
                     new deed was to take effect as from that agreed date. I also think that it is clear
                     that to the extent that the agreement to do this constituted a mutually agreed variation
                     of the terms of the SPA, acts done in performance of it were enforceable contractual
                     obligations. Consequently the agreement by the Company to grant a new charge on the
                     specified date gave rise to a new contractually enforceable charge, which took effect
                     on that specified date.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Joint Administrators suggest that the legal basis for the Charge is not in fact
                     the contract to grant the charge, but the failed charge itself. In this regard they
                     rely on <i>Re Fireproof Doors Ltd </i>[1916] 2 Ch 142, at pp.150-151, per Astbury J (followed in <i>Rushingdale Ltd SA v Byblos Bank SAL</i> (1986) 2 BCC 99509, at 99516-99518) as authority for the proposition that where,
                     as here, a company purports to execute a charge as a deed, but that deed is defective
                     in its execution, then the failed deed may itself take effect as a present agreement
                     to grant an equitable charge. I think they are correct to the extent that, if there
                     were no prior contract, a case for the existence of the charge could be founded on
                     the failed deed, and if it were, it would necessarily follow that such a charge was
                     created at the time when the deed was purportedly delivered. However, I perceive this
                     line of argument as additional to, rather than exclusive of, the argument that the
                     charge arose out of the contractual agreement to grant it.  I think that if the Second
                     Respondent wishes to argue, as he does, that the Charge was granted on the day on
                     which the contract concerned provided that it should be granted, the fact that he
                     could alternatively rely on the failed deed as giving rise to the charge does not
                     defeat his argument. Another way of putting this point is to say that although the
                     failed attempt to create a debenture clearly evidences the Charge, the Charge itself
                     arose from the contractual obligation to create it.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The ordinary problem with such a charge continuing in existence would be that it would
                     require registration. In this case particulars of registration were provided to the
                     registrar, but in respect of the ineffective Third Debenture, not the Charge. This
                     potentially raises the question of whether the submission of a registration in respect
                     of the failed deed could constitute a registration of the contractual charge so as
                     to render it valid.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">One way to argue this would be to say that because the registrar’s certificate has
                     been granted, the Charge can no longer be questioned, as laid down in s. s.859I(6)
                     of the Companies Act 2006, (see <i>In Re C. L. Nye Ltd</i>, [1971] 1 Ch. 442 (CA) – a case decided under the old law but, it seems, still generally
                     regarded as valid). However, there are limits to the unchallengeability of a certificate,
                     and in particular a registration could not render valid an invalidly created charge,
                     even under the old law - as Dillon J said in <i>R v Registrar of Companies, Ex Parte Central Bank Of India</i> [1986] 1 Q.B. 1114, the granting of a registrar’s certificate in respect of a charge
                     “has no effect on the true construction of the charge, and does not preclude it being
                     challenged on any other ground e.g. fraud or duress” (at 1183). It is therefore clear
                     that the registration of the Third Deed was not effective to validate it as such.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The remaining question is as to whether the purported registration of the deed could
                     have had the effect of validating the Charge. Since the Charge was intended to be
                     identical to that to be created by the Third Deed, the majority of the registration
                     statement would have been identical, and the substantive material required by s.859D
                     would have been present.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The registration of one charge cannot validate an entirely different charge. As was
                     correctly stated in the Australian case of <i>JJ Leonard Properties Pty Ltd v Leonard (WA) Pty Ltd (n Liquidation) </i>(1987) 13 ACLR 77, a registrar’s certificate is not any evidence that the requirements
                     as to the registration of an equitable charge to which the notice of charge did not
                     relate had been complied with. However, the Charge and the Third Deed were not entirely
                     different – indeed, they were intended to be created as part of a single design, and
                     to merge into each other. In this circumstance I think that the registration statement
                     submitted to the registrar correctly described the legal effect and consequence of
                     the Charge, and the registrar’s certificate should be held to cover the Charge. I
                     think that this is equally true whether the Charge is taken to have arisen from the
                     contractual obligation or from the failed attempt to embody it in a deed – in both
                     cases, the result was the creation of a charge which was different in some respects
                     from that described in the particulars of registration,  but in both cases the description
                     of the charge filed with the registrar was an exact description of the charge which
                     the chargor had granted, except for its legal form.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Consequently I find that a valid, registered contractual charge came into effect as
                     from the date on which the parties had agreed that it should do so – the 22nd January.
                     I do not think that the fact that the invalid deed was not effected until some days
                     after this date has any relevance to that finding.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The term “consideration” in s.245 seems to bear a different meaning from that which
                     it bears in contract law. That was the position under the predecessor to section 245;
                     <i>Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd</i> [1965] Ch. 148, at 171, per Harman LJ, and at 178, per Russell LJ. The learned editors
                     of <i>Palmer's Company Law</i> (Volume 4) explain, at 13.199.35, that given the similarity between both provisions,
                     and that both refer to “consideration”, “consideration” should be given the same meaning
                     in both provisions.  In <i>In Re Peak Hotels and Resorts Limited (In Liquidation) [2019] EWCA Civ 345</i> at [16], Henderson LJ concluded that he “provisionally incline[d] to the view that
                     the word “consideration” is still being used in a non-technical sense” and that <i>Re Yeovil Glove Co Ltd</i> still applied. However, he expressly declined to determine the issue finally as it
                     was not necessary so to do.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In this case it is necessary to determine the point, but I do not think that is its
                     one of very great difficulty. If a company were to agree to grant a charge in exchange
                     for funding, the contractual consideration would be the exchange of contractual promises.
                     The performance of that obligation by the payment of money would not constitute “consideration”
                     in the contractual sense, since the mere performance of an existing contractual obligation
                     cannot itself constitute consideration in the contractual sense. However, it seems
                     clear from the existing cases on s.245 that they regard “consideration” as meaning
                     the actual lending of money, not the mere promise to do so. It is equally clear that
                     if a financing proceeds in three stages; first the making of an agreement to provide
                     finance and to grant a charge, second the granting of the charge, and third the payment
                     over of the promised financing, the requirements of s.245 would be satisfied even
                     though neither the making of the payment nor the granting of the charge would, in
                     contractual terms, constitute “consideration”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This logic applies equally to the transfer of shares here. In contractual terms that
                     transfer did not constitute “consideration”, since it was simply the performance of
                     a pre-existing contractual obligation. The requirement here must therefore be to look
                     at the point at which valuable property or services were in fact transferred.  That
                     was clearly the date of completion of the transfer of the shares – that is, the 22
                     January.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The transfer of property therefore did not itself constitute “consideration” under
                     any existing contract. However, it does constitute consideration for the purposes
                     of s.245, since the section uses the term “consideration” to mean actual value transferred.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I think that this conclusion is also inherent in the conclusions actually reached
                     in <i>In Re Peak Hotels and Resorts Limited (In Liquidation)</i> [2019] EWCA Civ 345. In that case the chargee, Candey, had contracted to supply services.
                     Henderson LJ said (at [36])

                  <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>
                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“Those services were supplied pursuant to the Fixed Fee Agreement, but for the purposes
                           of section 245 the question is not what sum was contractually due from PHRL to Candey
                           in return for those services. … The relevant issue is the extent to which Candey is
                           entitled to enforce its charge, and for that purpose what has to be ascertained is
                           the value, calculated in accordance with section 245(6), of the services actually
                           supplied by Candey to PHRL during the relevant period.”

                     means value actually supplied, regardless of the contractual position.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Even if the charge was validly created, it is only valid under s.245 to the extent
                     that value was given specifically in respect of the grant of that charge. This follows
                     from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <i>Re Shoe Lace Ltd</i> (sub. nom. <i>Power v Sharp</i>,  [1993] BCC 609). In that case the Court held that the decisions in a series of
                     previous cases were wrong, in that they had been based on the incorrect proposition
                     that payment made on account of the consideration for a charge, in anticipation of
                     its creation and in reliance on a promise to execute it, would satisfy the requirements
                     of the section. This was held to be  incorrect on the basis that the requirements
                     of consideration and contemporaneity were in fact separate. Thus a charge can be struck
                     down under s.245 on two entirely separate grounds; one being that value is transferred
                     to the grantor prior to the creation of the charge, and the other being that the value
                     transferred was not transferred in consideration for the grant of the charge.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Joint Administrators submit that, even if the shares transferred constitute value,
                     they were not transferred in consideration of the grant of the charge. Their argument
                     is that the shares were transferred pursuant to the SPA in exchange for the issue
                     of the loan notes, and that the obligation to transfer the shares was entered into
                     when the SPA was entered into. They therefore say that the shares cannot have been
                     transferred “by reason of” the creation of a debenture created some time after the
                     assumption of that obligation

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I do not think that this is right. The SPA imposed an obligation on Mr Farah to transfer
                     the shares to the Company, and an obligation on the Company to (inter alia) grant
                     the charge. That agreement provided for both of those acts to be done on the date
                     on which the agreement was signed. Neither of those things were in fact done on that
                     date. Consequently both parties found themselves, some time later, in a position where
                     neither had performed their contractual obligations as set out in the SPA. I think
                     it is clear that they dealt with this by entering into another agreement by which
                     both of these obligations were to be discharged on the 22 January. I think it is this
                     agreement which supports the argument that the transfer was by reason of the charge.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"> It is entirely true that at any time after the failure of the First Debenture Mr
                     Farah was contractually bound to transfer the shares, and could in equity have been
                     compelled to do so. However, at the same time the Company was obliged to create a
                     charge, had not done so, and could in equity have been compelled to do so. It is highly
                     implausible that any order could have been secured to mandate one without mandating
                     the other. To my mind this emphasises the fact that the performance of each obligation
                     was in fact dependent on the performance of the other.

                     to the extent that it constitutes “money paid, or goods or services supplied”. It
                     could be argued that technically shares are neither money, nor goods, nor services,
                     and therefore fall outside the scope of “consideration” for this purpose. If this
                     construction were to be adopted, then the form of the transaction – the giving of
                     a floating charge to support the payment obligations incurred in the purchase of shares
                     - would always be vulnerable under s.245.

                     clearly the provision of finance to the Company, but it cannot be described as “money
                     paid”  to the Company.

                     services” is intended to mean in this context is unclear. Sealy &amp; Milman: Annotated
                     Guide to the Insolvency Legislation (25th Ed. – 2022), Volume 1:  observe that “Whether
                     paras (a) and (b) will themselves be open to a restrictive interpretation is unclear:
                     it is hard to see why other forms of valuable consideration (e.g. the transfer of
                     land or shares) were not included within the reform that was made”. However, the plain
                     language of the provision refers only to “money” “goods” and “services”. Shares are
                     not naturally described as “goods”. This is the point made by Armour and Bennett,
                     Vulnerable Transactions in Corporate Insolvency (2003), at 5.5913: 
                  </p>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“The use of the verb ‘supply’ and the choice of the terms ‘goods’ and ‘services’ rather
                           than broader terms such as ‘property’ indicate that many assets with considerable
                           value are excluded from the permissible forms of value under Section 245. Thus, consideration
                           for a floating charge in the form of rights over, for example, land, intellectual
                           property or choses in action would be regarded as of no value under the legislation.
                           While it is hard to justify this discrimination, it appears unavoidable as a matter
                           of statutory interpretation.”

                           extension in the concept of new value represents a compromise between the views of
                           the hardliners who considered that the old restriction to cash should be retained
                           and the proponents of the opposing view that any form of money’s worth should suffice.
                           The Cork committee rather cautiously recommended the addition of goods to cash but
                           the exclusion of services [Insolvency Law and Practice, Report of the Review Committee,
                           Cmnd. 8558, para 1564]. In the end, services were added to the list. The result in
                           broad terms is that admissible new value is restricted to those forms of benefit to
                           the company which arise from day-to-day trading and finance and have a readily ascertainable
                           value. Excluded are a wide range of other assets, both tangible and intangible, including
                           land and buildings, intellectual property rights, debts and other receivables and
                           rights under contracts.”

                     “goods” in this context, which should be understood to mean “forms of benefit to the
                     company which arise from day-to-day trading and finance and have a readily ascertainable
                     value”. Personally I find this construction appealing.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although I accept that the term “goods” has an ordinary legal meaning (generally accepted
                     to be that given in s. 61(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 as “all personal chattels
                     other than things in action and money”), this definition excludes a large number of
                     types of property which are everyday use in trade and financing, ranging from bills
                     of exchange and cheques to cryptocurrency, patents, real estate and software.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A good part of the reason that I find the Second Respondent’s proposed meaning attractive
                     is that the application of the Sale of Goods Act meaning in this context seems to
                     me to produce outcomes so bizarre that I find myself very unwilling to believe that
                     they can possibly represent the intention of the legislator. In a case such as this,
                     where property has been sold to a company, the Company has agreed to pay a price for
                     that property, the seller has agreed to the Company deferring its obligation to pay
                     the price, and the resulting debt is secured by a floating charge, it is in my view
                     impossible to produce any rational justification for saying that this rule should
                     apply to the sale of some types of property but not others. There is of course a concern
                     about the value of the property concerned, but this is fully addressed by s.245(6),
                     which requires any such property to be valued on an arms-length basis.

                     not only goods in the Sale of Goods sense, but also things in action (such as money
                     receivables) and intangibles (such as intellectual property) which are of a kind which
                     (a) are received by the Company pursuant to its ordinary trading activity and (b)
                     have a clear value, such that transfer of their ownership to the Company necessarily
                     swells the assets of the company.

                     that criterion. The Second Respondent also points out that since the Company was a
                     holding company, its stock in trade was shares of other companies, and it seems extremely
                     strange to argue that the acquisition of shares in a subsidiary by a holding company
                     does not constitute the conduct of its day-to-day activities.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Joint Administrators and the First Respondent have both referred me to <i>In Re Peak Hotels and Resorts Limited (In Liquidation)</i> [2019] EWCA Civ 345, which is clear authority for the proposition that the price
                     paid by the chargor for the consideration received  is not determinative of its value,
                     and that value can only be determined by an arms-length valuation. My starting-point
                     here is that the facts in <i>Peak Hotels</i> involved a situation where experts were wildly at variance with each other as to
                     the value of the services delivered. The challenge here, by contrast, seems to be
                     to ascertain whether the correct valuation of a company whose asset is a cash balance
                     of USD $2.3m is in fact $2.3m. However, the Joint Administrators point out that the
                     position is not quite this straightforward. One of the reasons for structuring the
                     transaction in the way in which it was in fact structured was to enable Mr Farah to
                     maintain a degree of control over the cash balance of DMCC. The Joint Administrators
                     point out – fairly – that the value of a limited right to control a cash balance may
                     well be considerably less than the value of that cash balance.

                     by DMCC prior to the Deed of Amendment, and it was that deed which imposed such restrictions.
                     However, the true position was that Mr Farah, who had de facto control of the DMCC
                     bank account, declined to allow the funds therein to be used for anything other than
                     trading transactions. The substance of the agreement which constituted the Renegotiation
                     was that Mr Farah would release that constraint, and allow the funds held by DMCC
                     to be applied for other group purposes, in exchange for (inter alia) the imposition
                     of formal bondholder control over the expenditure of cash by the Company. Mr Farah,
                     in effect, gave up his block on the DMCC account in exchange for control over the
                     Company’s use of cash.

                     which takes the form of “money paid, or goods or services supplied”. The issue here
                     is as to whether Mr Farah’s conduct in agreeing the Renegotiation could be construed
                     as the provision of a service to the Company.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I do not believe that a noteholder of a company who agrees to a renegotiation of the
                     terms of the note which he holds is supplying services to the Company for this purpose.
                     The key to this is the test articulated by Parker J in <i>Re Orleans Motor Company</i> – is the result of the arrangements an increase in the amount of assets available
                     for creditors? It is clear that the provision of intangible services can have this
                     effect. However, where the “service” provided is no more than a renegotiation of an
                     existing arrangement, and there is no immediate material benefit to the Company from
                     the renegotiation,  then there is no “consideration”. I note that this is the case
                     even though the actions of the creditor unquestionably would constitute consideration
                     in a contractual sense, but I think that is the intended and deliberate effect of
                     the words of limitation used in the section.

                     reached to the Company. However, it does not mean that entry into that agreement is
                     capable of constituting consideration here. The point is not that the concessions
                     made by Mr Farah in the Renegotiation were not valuable- they clearly were. The point
                     is that they did not have the effect of swelling the assets of the company available
                     to creditors by any measurable amount, and therefore cannot constitute consideration

                     agreed to constitute them in accordance with the terms set out in it. It provides
                     that each noteholder shall receive a certificate executed as a deed by the Company
                     specifying the amount of Notes which he holds. It is important that there is no provision
                     of the CLNI which requires (or even contemplates) the issue of physical notes. The
                     Notes are to have registered form, and the certificates are evidence of the fact that
                     the relevant entries have been made on the register. Thus, for example, the definition

                     the transaction being an issue of entirely new instruments. In particular, the fact
                     that the new Certificates describe the Notes as being those Notes whose issuance was
                     approved by the original board resolution in relation of 22 November 2019  suggests
                     very strongly that the transaction was simply an amendment of those Notes. The position
                     might have been different if there had been a new board resolution authorising the
                     issue of new notes on new terms, but there was not.

                     However s. 245 and its predecessors have in this regard been given a heavily purposive

                           of the existing debt in return for a new advance of the same amount. To avoid this

                     himself a creditor of a failing company, sought to improve his position by obtaining
                     security from the company in respect of that pre-existing debt. Parker J. in <i>In re Orleans Motor Co. Ltd</i> [1911] 2 Ch 41, speaking of a statutory predecessor of s.245, s.212 of the Companies
                     (Consolidation) Act, 1908, explained that "The section was designed apparently to
                     prevent companies on their last legs from creating floating charges to secure past
                     debts or for moneys which do not go to swell their assets and become available for

                     of the provision of services for the purposes of section 245(2)(a). At [31], Henderson
                     LJ explained that “it is important to begin by placing section 245 in its statutory
                     context in the law of insolvency and examining how the section operates”. At [32],
                     he explained that “section 245 is one of a group of sections which enable transactions
                     entered into during a specified period before the onset of insolvency to be set aside
                     or adjusted. Parliament has decided that these powers are needed in order to strike

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“The critical distinction between fixed and floating charges, at least in the present
                           context, is that a fixed charge necessarily attaches from its inception to existing
                           property of the company, whereas a floating charge remains in suspense until the happening
                           of a crystallising event, whereupon it will attach to the company’s assets of the
                           types specified in the charge as at the date of crystallisation, whether or not they
                           were in existence when the floating charge was created. This has the potential to
                           cause unfairness between the holder of a floating charge and the company’s unsecured
                           creditors if the charge is created at a time when the company is of doubtful solvency
                           and it later goes into liquidation or administration. In particular, the secured creditor
                           would be likely to gain an unfair advantage if it were thus able to obtain priority

                           terms, that is the mischief which section 245 seeks to combat. It does so, like its
                           predecessors in the Companies Acts of 1908 and 1948, by providing that a floating
                           charge over the company’s property or undertaking, created during the specified “relevant
                           period”, is invalid except to the extent specified in the section. […]”

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"> “I was referred to five earlier authorities in which the meaning of the expression
                           'cash paid to the company' was considered. They were <i>Re Orleans Motor Co Ltd </i>[1911] 2 Ch 41; <i>Re Hayman, Christy &amp; Lilly Ltd </i>[1917] 1 Ch 283; <i>Re Matthew Ellis Ltd</i> [1933] Ch 458, CA; Re Destone Fabrics Ltd [1941] Ch 319; and <i>Re Ambassadors (Bournemouth) Ltd</i> (1961) 105 Sol Jo 969. In some of those cases learned judges expressed general views
                           as to the transactions which the section was intended to defeat. Thus, in <i>Re Orleans Motor Co Ltd</i> [1911] 2 Ch 41 at 45, Parker J said that one of the apparent objects of the provision
                           was to prevent companies on their last legs from creating floating charges for moneys
                           which do not go to swell their assets and become available for creditors. In <i>Re Hayman, Christy &amp; Lilly Ltd</i> [1917] 1 Ch 283 at 285, Astbury J thought that the expression meant 'except the amount
                           of any cash absolutely and unconditionally paid to the company'. In <i>Re Matthew Ellis Ltd</i> [1933] Ch 458 at 464–5, Eve J at first instance disapproved the view of Astbury J,
                           but then excluded from the expression any payments of cash made upon the condition
                           that the cash should be applied in discharge of an existing, as opposed to a future,
                           liability of the company. The Court of Appeal disapproved all the views above mentioned
                           and held that a floating charge will not be invalidated merely by reason of the imposition
                           of a condition that the money advanced is to be applied by the company in discharge
                           of an existing liability, provided that the transaction is in substance for the benefit
                           of the company and not merely the substitution of a secured for an unsecured debt
                           and thus of benefit to one creditor at the expense of others. The question was expressed
                           in much the same way by Simonds J in <i>Re Destone Fabrics Ltd</i> [1941] Ch 319 at 324. He said that the ultimate test might well be whether the transaction
                           is to be regarded as one intended bona fide for the benefit of the company, or whether
                           it is intended merely to provide certain moneys for the benefit of certain of the
                           company's creditors to the prejudice of others. Finally, I should record that in <i>Re Orleans Motor Co Ltd</i> [1911] 2 Ch 41 at 45, Parker J had said that another of the apparent objects of the
                           section was to prevent companies on their last legs from creating floating charges
                           to secure past debts. There has never, I think, been any doubt about that. Indeed,
                           that part of Parker J's views was expressly approved by the Court of Appeal in <i>Re Matthew Ellis Ltd</i> [1933] Ch 458 which remains the most authoritative decision on the subject. Accordingly,
                           the primary question in each case is whether the transaction is in substance for the
                           benefit of the company and not merely the substitution of a secured for an unsecured
                           debt.

                           it was held that the charge was invalid. And each of them appears to me to have been
                           a case where it could be said that there had been a blatant attempt to obtain a benefit
                           for one creditor at the expense of others. In other words, there had been underhand
                           conduct of one kind or another. In my judgment, however, conduct of that kind is not
                           a pre-requisite to the operation of the section. In the present case it is not suggested
                           that there was any such conduct on the part of Lloyds in procuring the execution by
                           Whyte of the floating charge of 2 April 1974. For myself, I would like to say that
                           any such suggestion would have been manifestly unsustainable. Nevertheless, the primary
                           submission made by counsel for the liquidator (Mr Scott) was that, to the extent of
                           the first £12·75m, the floating charge was in substance created to secure Whyte's
                           past indebtedness to Lloyds. On that simple ground, submitted counsel for the liquidator
                           (Mr Scott), the charge was to that extent invalid.”

                     in substance for the benefit of Whyte. Its effect was merely to substitute for one

                     the company, advanced £10,000 to the company. Under the law at the time, this was
                     held to be a payment at the time of the floating charge (pp.930H-932B). After the
                     floating charge was executed, the director then advanced two further payments of £10,00
                     each. These were paid directly into the Company’s overdrawn bank account; the director
                     was a guarantor of the company’s indebtedness to the bank, and so the payments pro
                     tanto reduced the director’s liability to the bank.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The essence of the relevant parts of the decision in <i>Re Fairway Magazines </i>for this purpose is the finding as to the two payments of £10,000. It was held by
                     Mummery J.  that these payments “were not paid to the company within sec. 245(2)(a)
                     because they never became available to the company to use as it liked” (933 C). The
                     reason for this was that the payments were in fact made by the director to the company’s
                     bank on terms that his liability under his guarantee of the company’s indebtedness
                     to that bank would be reduced pro tanto. At no point did the company ever have any
                     control over the funds, or any say in their use. He distinguished the case of <i>In Re Matthew Ellis</i>, whose facts were very similar, on the basis that in that case the payment was for
                     the benefit of a supplier, and was “a business transaction which secured [for the
                     company] the goodwill of a firm which was willing to continue to supply goods to the
                     company on credit and so keep the business of the company going” (at p.993).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems to me that where a creditor of a company agrees to reduce or extinguish a
                     money claim on that company as part of a transaction whose consequences are that it
                     will acquire a new claim on that company of roughly equal value, that reduction or
                     extinguishment will not constitute consideration for the purposes of s.245. I agree
                     with Mummery J that in such a transaction, no new resources ever become available
                     to the company. I therefore think that, on the authorities as they stand, any exchange
                     transaction where a company’s liabilities on existing debt are extinguished, but only
                     on condition that the company becomes liable for a new debt to the same creditor will
                     fail this test. It should be noted here that the problem is not the exchange, it is
                     the automaticity. If a noteholder sold debt instruments issued by a company back to
                     that company, and then reinvested the proceed of sale in new notes issued by the same
                     company, this problem would not arise. The issue arises where the terms of the transaction
                     place the company in a position where incurring the new debt is the necessary price
                     of being released from the old debt. That is exactly the position in this case.

                           plainly do not amount to payments in cash. Where, for instance, an existing creditor
                           of a company takes a debenture from the company to secure the amount of his debt on
                           the terms that he shall not immediately press for payment of his debt, or where he
                           takes a debenture for the amount of his debt on the terms that the debt itself is
                           to be extinguished, obviously no cash passes from the debenture holder to the company.
                           If in such a case he goes through the form of drawing a cheque in favour of the company
                           for the amount of his debt on the terms that the company shall forthwith itself hand
                           to him in exchange a cheque for the same amount, there has in form been a payment
                           in cash. But in such a case there has not been a payment in cash if one looks at the
                           substance and not at the form, and in considering whether there has been a payment
                           of cash within the meaning of s. 266  it is always the question of substance that

                           to certain directors of the sums due to them in preference to other creditors of the
                           company, and payment also to Davis who was himself advancing the money on the security
                           of the debenture. The ultimate test in such cases may well be whether the transaction
                           is to be regarded as one intended bona fide for the benefit of the company, or whether
                           it is intended merely to provide certain moneys for the benefit of certain creditors
                           of the company to the prejudice of other creditors of the company.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I do not agree with this submission. The present case is an example of the position
                     where there is no subterfuge, no dishonesty, and where it seems to me that all parties
                     acted honestly and with probity. The striking down of a floating charge under this
                     section does not carry any implication of wrongfulness - as Nourse J said in the case
                     of <i>Re Whyte</i> (at p. 317b), the presence of such conduct is not a statutory prerequisite for the
                     operation of those provisions. Equally, I strongly disagree that a debt restructuring
                     transaction of the kind before me is anything other than a perfectly normal commercial
                     transaction. One of the distinguishing features of s.245 is that it can operate in
                     situations where all those concerned were acting in a way which they believed to be
                     transparent and honest, and that appears to be exactly the case here.

                     why the approach under section 245(2)(a) and 245(2)(b) should differ, the applicability
                     of this line of authorities to section 245(2)(b) was considered (albeit briefly and

                           that the sentiment behind what Mummery J said in Re Fairway Magazines Ltd [1992] BCC
                           924 at 932 (“If the effect of a payment, which in form made to the company, is merely
                           to substitute secured debt for unsecured debt, then the payment is not in substance
                           a payment to the company”) is not applicable where the relevant consideration falls
                           within section 245(2)(b), she expressed the view that such a suggestion would be wrong.
                           As to that, like her, I do not understand that section 245(2)(b) has altered the general
                           purposes of section 245, which is to prevent a company that is on its last legs from
                           creating a floating charge to secure past debts or to secure moneys which do not go

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Farah raises a further point in respect of s.245(2)(b). This is based on the fact
                     that one of the significant terms of the renegotiation was that Mr Farah would consent
                     to the release for group purposes of some of the funds held by DMCC. Pursuant to this
                     agreement, DMCC paid out USD $1,726,849.80 as set out at paras 61 to 65 of Mr Farah’s
                     witness statement.  That included USD $760,000 on 13 August 2020 on behalf of the
                     Company to acquire shares in Stratura, USD $119,000 on 14 September 2020 on behalf
                     of the Company to acquire shares in Nynas; and USD $187,548.77 and AED 94,864 was
                     paid between June and October 2020 to pay professional fees incurred by the Company,
                     including those in connection with the acquisition of the Stratura and Nynas shares.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In principle this money was owned by the Company from the date of the SPV onwards
                     - it was owned by a subsidiary entity of which it had complete voting control. However,
                     voting control of an entity and actual control of its assets may not be synonymous.
                     The Company may have owned these balances, but it did not control them. For these
                     purposes, I do not think it is relevant whether Mr Farah’s de facto veto on their
                     deployment was valid as a matter of law – it was clearly a very real fact on the ground.

                     as part of the Renegotiation was of considerable value to the Company, in that it
                     enabled it to deploy its assets in accordance with its strategy.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my view, it did not. The starting point is to return – once again – to the idea
                     that consideration in this regard is that which swells the assets of the company concerned
                     and becomes available for creditors. On an insolvency of the Company, it seems likely
                     that Mr Farah’s power to restrict the utilisation of the account would in effect have
                     terminated – if DMCC were placed in the local equivalent of a members voluntary liquidation,
                     it is difficult to see how the relevant cash balances would not have been made available
                     to the local liquidator, and then to the creditors of the Company.  Consequently I
                     think that at all material times after the Company acquired DMCC, the assets of DMCC
                     would have been available to creditors of the Company in a winding-up. Consequently,
                     I do not believe that Mr Farah’s agreement to partially remove his veto over their
                     deployment had the effect of increasing the assets of the Company, and for that reason
                     I do not believe that it constituted consideration under s.245.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, I should say a word about the process by which this judgment came to be delivered.
                     I am asked by the Joint Administrators to give directions on three points. The answers
                     to the second and third points depend to some extent on the direction given in respect
                     of the first. In the oral hearing before me, the focus of the submissions of the parties
                     was almost exclusively on the second and third points. In considering the matter further
                     in the course of writing my first draft judgment, I concluded that the first point
                     was more difficult than I had thought. I set out in the draft judgment that I circulated
                     my preliminary conclusions on it. However, the parties, upon receipt of that draft,
                     represented (correctly) that if the point was as important as I considered it to be,
                     they should be able to make further representations in respect of it. I decided that
                     the appropriate course would be to permit further submissions to be made, and have
                     now received those submissions from all parties. This judgment is therefore substantially
                     different from the draft originally circulated.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The fact that my judgment was circulated as a draft judgment means that, as a procedural
                     matter,  I have a discretion whether or not to receive further submissions and to
                     reconsider it. However that discretion cannot be, and should not be, exercised capriciously.
                     More importantly, if a Judge has simply got things wrong, it is not for him to conduct
                     an appeal against his own judgment (<i>In re St Nazaire Company</i> (1879) 12 Ch D 88). I have therefore considered carefully the extent to which it
                     is permissible for me to substantially revise my initial draft in the light of the
                     further submissions received.

                           up. On the other hand, in <i>re Blenheim Leisure (Restaurants) Ltd</i>, Neuberger J gave some examples of cases where it might be just to revisit the earlier

                     and I think it is only appropriate to ensure that it has been fully and properly argued
                     before giving judgment. It is not suggested that these issues were fully argued before
                     me, and the further submissions from counsel for the Joint Administrators consist
                     of 21 pages of closely-reasoned analysis. I have derived a great deal of benefit from
                     them, as well as from the further submissions of all the other parties

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I accept that this is not an ideal way to have proceeded, and I am aware that, as
                     Peter Gibson LJ pointed out in <i>Robinson v Fernsby</i> [2004] WTLR 257, para 120, judicial tergiversation is not to be encouraged. However,
                     it seems to me that since the outcome will be a judgment which has had the benefit
                     of full submissions on all of the material points, it is the approach which best serves
                     the interests of justice.
