On 19 December 2019 the employer invoked a clause in the contract enabling it, following the employee having resigned, to “terminate the [employee’s] employment forthwith” by paying to him the salary, excluding bonuses, to which he would have been entitled in the remainder of the period of notice that had been given by him. As a result, the contract ended on 19 December 2019, instead of on 16 January 2020. </span></p><p><span style="color:#000000">The employment tribunal considered itself bound by the majority decision of the EAT in </span><b><span style="color:#000000">Marshall (Cambridge) Limited v Hamblin</span></b><span style="color:#000000"> [1994] ICR 962, to conclude that the invocation, following a resignation, of a clause permitting the employer to terminate the contract upon making a prescribed payment calculated by reference to the unexpired period of the employee’s notice does not, as a matter of law, amount to a dismissal. On appeal the employee accepted that </span><b><span style="color:#000000">Marshall v Hamblin</span></b><span style="color:#000000"> stood for that proposition of law, and that if it must be followed, then the appeal must be dismissed.

One of them is where a previous decision is “manifestly wrong”, which means that it can be seen to be obviously wrong, without the need for extensive or complicated argument: </span><b><span style="color:#010302">British Gas Trading v Lock</span></b><span style="color:#010302"> [2016] ICR 503 </span><span style="color:#000000">at [77] to [80].

In the Notice of Appearance the respondents have said that they used their discretion in making a payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the terms and conditions of employment.  An employer, in our view, cannot make a payment in lieu of an unexpired period of notice already given by an employee.  The meaning of "in lieu of" is perfectly plain.

A  payment in lieu of notice, as the Court of Appeal have recently emphasised, is a payment of liquidated damages for breach of a contract of employment.  In a case where the prospect of earning commission during the notice period may be a substantial one, a payment in lieu of notice will not absolve an employer from his obligations.  We agree with Miss Boswell that an employee cannot insist on remaining in employment after giving notice.  In circumstances such as this, a mutual agreement is called for.  Such a mutual agreement, as pointed out in </b><b><i><u>McAlwane v Boughton Estates Ltd</u></i></b><b> [1973] 2 A11 ER 299, a case referred to us by Miss Boswell, will not alter the original character of the termination of contract of employment; it will merely alter the notice period.

However, the summary dismissal is effective to put an end to the employment relationship, whether or not it unilaterally discharges the contract of employment.

The waiver of the employer is in relation to the period of notice (provided he pays the appropriate sum in lieu).

All payments are made at the discretion of the Company under the terms of the contract. We considered whether, although there was no right to payment of commission, was there a breach by the employer of preventing the employee from placing himself in a position where the Company's discretion could be exercised towards him?

Those words read alone might suggest that they understood the case to be one in which the employment still ended on the date given in the employee’s notice. But, as EJ Dyal discussed, reading the decision as a whole, the majority appear to have regarded the case as one in which, factually, the employer used a term of the contract to bring the employment to an end on a date earlier than the date on which the employee’s notice would otherwise have expired. On that reading, the phrase “until the expiry of the notice” was a loose compression that perhaps meant, more precisely, something like: “ in the amount that would have been due in the period remaining until the expiry of the notice.” In all events, as I have noted, Mr Jackson did not pursue on appeal the argument that the case was viewed by the majority as factually one in which the original termination date did not change.</span></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_38"><span class="judgment-body__number">38.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="color:#010302">Proceeding from that understanding of the facts of the case, in his skeleton argument for this appeal, Mr Solomon described </span><b><span style="color:#010302">Marshall v Hamblin</span></b><span style="color:#010302"> as “authority for the proposition that there is no dismissal when, following an employee’s resignation, the employer exercises a contractual right to bring forward the effective date of termination”.

First, Mr Solomon of course accepted that the </span><i><span style="color:#010302">mere</span></i><span style="color:#010302"> fact, in a given case, that the employer’s conduct is compliant with the contract does not, without more, mean that its conduct is not a termination by it, and hence a dismissal.

The nub of his case, in short, is that it is plainly and obviously wrong to suggest that this combination of features makes any difference.

The same can be said of another case on which Mr Jackson relied for illustrative purposes, </span><b><span style="color:#010302">Palfrey v Transco plc</span></b><span style="color:#010302"> [2004] IRLR 916, although there the dismissal was found to have been “brought forward” by a fresh employer’s notice, with the adverse consequence for the employee that his tribunal claim was out of time.</span></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_49"><span class="judgment-body__number">49.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="color:#010302">Mr Jackson argued that, as they all involved the date of a dismissal being “brought forward” in accordance with the employee’s wishes expressed following the dismissal, these authorities were simply of no relevance to a scenario in which the employee has resigned on notice, and then the employer acts unilaterally to cause the employment to end earlier, without the employee, following the resignation, having specifically agreed to that. However, I am not sure that it can be said that it is obvious that there is nothing in the discussion in any of these authorities that might inform the approach to the issue at hand. It would, I think, require some consideration or analysis of them, to come to a firm conclusion about that.</span></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_50"><span class="judgment-body__number">50.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="color:#010302">The second point is that, even leaving aside whether that particular body of authority arguably has any relevant insights to offer, I do not, ultimately, think that I can say that it is simply not reasonably arguable that a provision </span><i><span style="color:#010302">of the contract itself</span></i><span style="color:#010302"> could provide, or have the legal effect, that, following a resignation, the employer can, without </span><i><span style="color:#010302">also</span></i><span style="color:#010302"> needing the post-resignation agreement of the employee, cause the employment to end sooner than the date given by the employee, by making the employee a contractually-prescribed payment, by reference to the unexpired period of the employee’s notice, in a way that only alters how and when the resignation takes effect.</span></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_51"><span class="judgment-body__number">51.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="color:#010302">Having, after considerable reflection, come to the conclusion that I cannot say that these points are obviously not reasonably arguable, I am driven to the conclusion, despite my misgivings about the substantive reasoning in the decision itself, that the proposition of law which, it was common ground before me, emerges from </span><b><span style="color:#010302">Marshall v Hamblin</span></b><span style="color:#010302">, is not one that I can say is manifestly wrong. I have therefore concluded that I cannot depart from it on this point; and I will therefore refrain from considering these lines of argument any further, or indicating how I would have decided the point had I considered myself free to do so. Resolution of it must be left to the Court of Appeal.</span></p></div></section><section><p><b><u><span style="color:#010302">Outcome </span></u></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_52"><span class="judgment-body__number">52.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><span style="color:#010302">Ultimately, I have concluded that, like the employment tribunal, I am bound to follow </span><b><span style="color:#010302">Marshall v Hamblin</span></b><span style="color:#010302">.
