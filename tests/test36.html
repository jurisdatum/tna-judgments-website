The results of the tests (usually giving rise to substandard or unsatisfactory outcomes) are published and socialised.

In the period covered by the appeal NCAPs have been seeded in south-east Asia, Latin America, India and South Africa.  New jurisdictions for establishment of a programme are identified by the Appellant by reference to road fatality statistics.  The Appellant funds local NCAPs in relation to the initial purchase of vehicles to be tested.  </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(5)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the start up phase for an NCAP it is necessary to test vehicles without manufacturer support as the independence of the testing programme is critical in order to establish consumer credibility.   These initial tests are funded by the Appellant.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(6)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The testing programme typically involves a number of crash tests on a particular model of car through which forward and side impact to the vehicle is monitored.  The tests use instrumented dummies to measure the crash forces that can lead to injury.  The testing facilities used by the Appellant are not located in the UK.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(7)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The early phase of testing frequently exposes that the vehicles manufactured in an economy with historically low car (or certainly new car) ownership, perform poorly.  It is often the case that in these emerging markets the vehicles manufactured do not meet the minimum safety standards set by the United Nations.  As a consequence it is rarely in the manufacturers’ interests to obtain the first baseline safety assessment.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(8)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Appellant generates publicity of the results though social media, news coverage, trade press etc. (examples of which were available to the Tribunal).  Informed customers look to purchase the safest vehicles they can afford to buy by reference to the data produced and disseminated by the Appellant and thereby drive manufacturers to improve the safety standard of the models available at each price point.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(9)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After a number of test phases manufacturer performance improves as vehicle models incorporate increasing effective safety features as standard.  Manufacturers then proactively seek and make payment for the testing of these improved models.  In essence the manufacturers want to show the market that safety has been improved deriving commercial advantage from that improvement.  Such manufacturers will use the improved ratings in their own marketing of the vehicles.  By way of example the Renault Kwid when originally launched in India in 2016 received a zero-star rating, however, when the revised model was launched in 2018 it had 4 air bags, Renault paid for a safety test thereby credentialising the improvement in safety.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(10)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As the market sophistication increases the NCAP star ratings for vehicles are used by the manufacturers in promotion of the vehicles.  They are also a feature in independent evaluation of vehicles, for example <i>Which? </i>And <i>What Car</i> magazines include the Euro NCAP ratings in all vehicle reviews. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(11)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The aim of the Appellant is for each jurisdictional NCAP to ultimately become self-funding through manufacturer testing fees and for the NCAP to then  operate independently from the Appellant.  This method of establishment is proving successful.  By 2018, Safer Cars for India, had awarded its first 5-star rating for a car and manufacturer funded testing was commonplace.  In parallel the Indian Government improved the regulated safety environment mandating the minimum UN crash test standards.  Similarly, for Latin America by 2019 83% of the testing undertaken had become manufacturer funded.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(12)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In a jurisdiction with an established and mature programme of manufacturer funded testing, non-manufacturer requested testing will periodically continue to be undertaken to maintain independence, particularly in weakly regulated markets and to ensure that under-performing models are still rated.  100% manufacturer funded testing will therefore never be the aim of an established NCAP.  For the autonomous NCAPs the “free” tests are undertaken for the benefit of the programme as a whole and the cost is met as a general cost of providing the taxable supplies of manufacturer funded tests.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(13)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the jurisdictions under establishment in the periods covered by the assessment (south-east Asia, Latin America, India and South Africa) it is the Appellant which has made supplies of testing to the manufacturers who have paid for such tests.  The income generated from such testing has increased year on year and it is not disputed that such income is consideration for a supply of taxable services (albeit that the place of supply of such services is that of the manufacturer in question and not the UK).</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">(14)</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The majority of the costs incurred by the Appellant are non-UK costs i.e. the cost of purchasing the vehicles to be tested and the conduct of the tests are non-UK costs, and no UK VAT is incurred in connection with them.  However, as the Appellant is established in and operated from the UK it incurs input tax in connection with its overhead running costs, particularly marketing and consultancy costs.  It is the recovery of these costs which are at issue in this appeal.</p></div></section></div></section></section><section><p><b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Legislation</span></b></p><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_11"><span class="judgment-body__number">11.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Article 2(1) Principal VAT Directive (<b>PVD</b>) provides that “the supply of goods for a consideration within the territory of a Member State by a taxable person action as such” shall be subject to VAT.  </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_12"><span class="judgment-body__number">12.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“Taxable person” is defined in Article 9 PVD as “any person who, independently, carries out in any place any economic activity, whatever the purpose or results of that activity”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_13"><span class="judgment-body__number">13.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Sections 4 and 5 Value Added Taxes Act 1994 (<b>VATA</b>) provide the domestic implementation of Articles 2 and 9 though the language adopted replaces economic activity with “business”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_14"><span class="judgment-body__number">14.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Articles 168 PVD and the domestic implementation in section 26 provides for a taxable person to credit as input tax in respect of so much of the VAT it incurs on supplies made to it as is attributable to taxable supplies made by it.</p></div></section></section><section><p><b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Relevant case law</span></b></p></section><section><p><b><span style="font-variant:normal">Wakefield College</span></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_15"><span class="judgment-body__number">15.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The case of <i>Wakefield College v HMRC </i>[2018] EWCA Civ 952 provides the latest authoritative test by reference to which the question as to whether an activity constitutes a business or economic activity is determined.

Sveda intended to carry out the independent economic activity of offering the sale of food and souvenirs to path users.

The period of investment, on the evidence, was up to 3 – 4 years in which a series of crash tests needed to be conducted at the Appellant’s cost in order to establish the base line for safety improvements and to establish the consumer impetus for manufacturers to make the necessary improvements in safety features for newer models and to want to proactively seek testing to establish and leverage that improvement.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_24"><span class="judgment-body__number">24.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It was denied that the charitable/philanthropic objective of improving road safety so as to reduce and ultimately eliminate safety related road fatalities had the effect that the activities undertaken were for a non-business purpose.

The Appellant also disputes that any contention that its articles of association preclude it undertaking a permanent trading activity represents a basis for contending that the non-manufacturer funded tests are a non-business activity.

In that case the taxpayer undertook both economic/business and non-economic activities from the cathedral building to which the bridge provided access.  The bridge provided access to the peninsula on which the cathedral was stood but users of the bridge may, or may not, access the cathedral and only some of those who accessed the cathedral would be the recipient of taxable supplies.  HMRC had denied input tax recovery for the works on the basis that they were attributable to the non-business activities of that taxpayer. The FTT determined that whilst there was no direct and immediate link to any particular taxable supply the costs represented a component of both the non-business and business activities carried on and a proportion of the costs were recoverable.  However, the Appellant contended that in its case there was no non-business activity undertaken (for the reasons set out above) and accordingly, the input tax on general overheads was fully recoverable.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_27"><span class="judgment-body__number">27.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">HMRC contend that the Appellant is engaged in both business and non-business activities and, as such, pursuant to section 26 VATA the residual input tax incurred should, in part, be irrecoverable.  This is on the basis that as the non-manufacturer funded tests are, by their nature, provided for free, those tests cannot represent a supply for consideration and are not therefore supplies capable of representing a business activity applying the <i>Wakefield </i>tests.  Further, the purpose for which the tests are carried out are in order to meet the Appellant’s charitable/philanthropic objectives.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_28"><span class="judgment-body__number">28.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the basis that the Appellant is engaged in activities which are both economic and non-economic in nature HMRC submit that input tax on overheads is required to be restricted.</p></div></section><section><p><b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Discussion</span></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_29"><span class="judgment-body__number">29.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is no dispute that certain of the crash tests undertaken by the Appellant are provided for no consideration and thus do not represent supplies of services made for consideration (the position for the established NCAPs is likely to be different with the price paid by manufacturers also potentially representing consideration for the “free” tests undertaken for the credibility and benefit of the programme as a whole).  Thus, for the Appellant taken in isolation, the provision of “free” tests cannot represent a business activity of the Appellant.  In isolation this “free” testing does not meet with <i>Wakefield</i> test.  However, and despite the Tribunal having raised the application of <i>Wakefield</i>, the dispute cannot be determined by reference to the application of the <i>Wakefield</i> analysis as, on reflection, that analysis is properly focused on whether any charges made by a taxpayer, firstly represent consideration (in the sense of representing a reciprocal payment for the provision of goods/services) and secondly whether the receipt of the charges represents income or remuneration in the sense of constituting a business activity and are thereby subject to a charge to output tax.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_30"><span class="judgment-body__number">30.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In this case the critical question is whether the “free” testing represents an independent activity at all and if they do represent an independent activity whether the input tax incurred in connection with general overhead expenditure should be attributed to that activity.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_31"><span class="judgment-body__number">31.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the basis of the uncontested evidence of Mr Ward, as supported by the documentary material available, it is clear that manufacturers would not proactively seek to have vehicles tested without an initial unfavourable baseline assessment.  Manufactures work within the legal and regulatory framework in each jurisdiction and, presumably, aim to manufacture the most competitively priced vehicles at each price point.  It is not until consumers and/or regulators/legislators demand a higher safety standard at each relevant price point that manufacturers design vehicles to meet that higher standard.  Once improvements have been made the manufacturers then wish to proactively demonstrate that improvement by obtaining a higher test result which they can then use to credentialise the vehicle.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_32"><span class="judgment-body__number">32.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Through the purchase and testing of new entrant vehicles in each market jurisdiction the Appellant can establish a baseline of safety for vehicle production in that market.

In this regard, the position is materially indistinguishable from that in <i>Sveda</i>.

In a second limb to the dispute HMRC contended that if input tax was to be recovered in connection with the purchase of the voucher output tax was due when they were given away.  The Court of Appeal (upholding the Upper Tribunal) determined (as contended by the taxpayer) that the evidence had established that despite the fact that the vouchers were given away the input tax incurred on their purchase was a general overhead cost of and directly linked to the supply of newspapers.   Despite there being a causal link between the purchase of the voucher and it being given away there was nevertheless an economic link between the cost of the voucher and the distribution of the newspapers.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_36"><span class="judgment-body__number">36.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Court further held that no output tax charge was due on the free provision of the voucher.

As the vouchers were given away for a business purpose they did not otherwise fall within the charge to output tax where goods/services are put to private/non-business purposes.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_37"><span class="judgment-body__number">37.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Similarly, in the present case, the Tribunal considers that the provision of free testing is an inherent and integral part of the Appellant’s business activity giving rise and as such there is no basis on which to restrict input tax.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_38"><span class="judgment-body__number">38.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The above conclusion is not affected by the restriction in the Appellant’s articles of association precluding it from engaging in a trading activity.  That is a standard article for a charity and concerns its direct tax status.  Charities are no precluded from being engaged in a business activity for VAT purposes by reference to such a clause.  Had there been any force in that argument it would also have vitiated HMRC’s accepted position on the manufacturer funded testing.</p></div></section><section><p><b><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Disposition</span></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_39"><span class="judgment-body__number">39.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the reasons set out above the Tribunal determines that there is no separate activity associated with the “free” provision of testing services and all input tax incurred is attributable to the accepted business activity of testing supplied to manufacturers.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_40"><span class="judgment-body__number">40.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Accordingly, the assessments should be set aside, and the appeal allowed.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_41"><span class="judgment-body__number">41.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, as a postscript, the Tribunal notes on the basis of the case law established in <i>Van Boekel v HMC&amp;E </i>[1981] STC 290 and <i>Pegasus Bird Ltd v HMC&amp;E </i>[2004] EWCA Civ 1015 there is no basis on which to conclude that had there been a justified basis for the assessment that the assessment would not have been made to best judgment.
