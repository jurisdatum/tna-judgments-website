                     driving.  On 4<sup>th</sup> June 2021, he was sentenced to ten months' imprisonment.  He was disqualified from

                     that those instructions were given by the applicant to the solicitors before sentence
                     was imposed and therefore before he absconded.  Accordingly, applying the principles

                     Hampstead Road and Eversholt Street, London NW1.  Class A drug users would call their

                     came out of a local hostel, used a phone box and then walked quickly along Eversholt
                     Street.  They followed him on bicycles.  He approached a parked car and got into the
                     front passenger seat.  The applicant was the driver.  The officers suspected that
                     a drug deal was about to be carried out between the two men and so they decided to
                     detain and search them, along with the vehicle, under section 23 of the Misuse of
                     Drugs Act 1971.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The defence applied under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984
                     to exclude all references to drugs and drug dealing as being the reason for the attempt
                     to stop the applicant on the basis that the prejudicial effect of this evidence would
                     outweigh any probative value it might have.  The prosecution submitted that the officers'
                     suspicion was important explanatory evidence for the jury properly to understand the
                     case, and that it supported the prosecution's contention as to why the applicant might
                     not have wished to comply with the instruction to stop his car and drove off in a
                     dangerous manner.  The prosecution accepted that a direction should be given that
                     there was no evidence that the applicant was dealing in drugs.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In her ruling, the Recorder rejected the application by the defence.  She set out
                     the relevant principles she had to apply.  She decided that the officers' suspicions
                     and the reasons for them were important explanatory evidence for the jury. Without
                     hearing evidence from the officers about their reasons for attempting to stop the
                     vehicle, the jury would not properly be able to understand the case.  In particular,
                     the prosecution would effectively be prevented from putting a positive case about
                     the reasons why the applicant may have driven in the way alleged and the police officers
                     would be prevented from explaining to the jury why they acted in the way they did,
                     which could lead to the jury being given a misleading impression of the evidence of
                     those officers.   defence would be able to cross-examine the officers.  In his police
                     interview the applicant had provided an explanation for the meeting that had taken
                     place.  The jury would need to be directed that the applicant faced a charge of dangerous
                     driving and not drugs offences.  Any perceived or actual prejudice to the applicant
                     could be overcome by a direction.  The evidence would not have such an adverse effect
                     on the fairness of proceedings that it ought not to be admitted.

                     to detain the men for a drugs search.  As he approached the vehicle on his bicycle
                     he shouted "Police – stop!" He approached the driver's side and stopped.  He was astride
                     his bicycle with his feet on the ground.  Suddenly the car came towards him and his
                     bicycle was "almost being sucked under the car".  It all happened very quickly and
                     he had to use his hands on the car to push himself away from it as his bicycle went
                     under the wheel.  He shouted "Police – stop!" a number of times, and his colleagues
                     also shouted.  The driver sped off.  The officer's bicycle was dragged underneath
                     the car, until it was dislodged at the next junction.

                     bicycle underneath.  He saw the passenger exit the vehicle while it was moving and
                     tumble into the road.  The officer relayed the registration number by radio.  He caught
                     up with the car when it was held up in traffic and he tried to open the driver's door
                     to detain the driver.  Again, he said "Police – stop!", but the driver managed to

                     towards PC Murphy and then drove off at speed.  The witness believed that PC Murphy
                     would have gone under the vehicle if he had not managed to push himself clear.  The
                     vehicle was going very fast and the bicycle was dragged under it for about 50 metres.
                     He followed the vehicle while he could and it was his belief that the passenger was
                     pushed out when it was moving, because he ended up on the road head first.

                     wanted to buy some perfumes from him for Mother's Day.  His friend got into the car.
                     He seemed worried and told him to drive off straight away.  As he did so, he saw men
                     running towards the car.  He did not know that they were police officers.  They were
                     not in uniform and they did not say that they were the police.  It seemed very aggressive.
                     He thought he was under attack and so he drove away.  Something got stuck under his

                     nothing to the prosecution case.  The evidence implied that the passenger had gone
                     to the car to buy drugs and that the applicant was a dealer attempting to evade the
                     police.  The jury should not have been told that the police were intending to conduct
                     a drugs search.  The prosecution case could have been put simply on the basis that
                     the police were investigating crime in the area.  The prejudicial effect could not
                     be cured by judicial direction.  The evidence should not have gone before the jury.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In a Respondent's Notice the prosecution submits that the reason for the factual suspicion
                     was important explanatory evidence to assist in the jury's understanding of the case.
                     It also lent support to the prosecution case as to why the applicant might have decided
                     not to comply with the officers' instruction to stop and instead decided to drive
                     dangerously in order to get away from the police.  It is submitted that the Recorder
                     exercised her discretion correctly.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In our judgment there is no merit in the proposed ground of appeal.  It is unarguable
                     that the conviction is unsafe.  First, the defence were correct not to suggest that
                     the evidence to which they objected was irrelevant.  Second, it was not suggested
                     that that evidence engaged the bad character code in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.
                     The evidence was material and had to do with the alleged facts of the offence charged
                     (see section 98(a)).  Third, the sole basis upon which the Recorder was asked to exclude
                     the evidence was section 78 of the 1984 Act.  Fourth, there is no suggestion that
                     the Recorder misdirected herself as to the correct principles to be applied.  She
                     set out her reasoning clearly and carefully.  In reality, the applicant's criticism
                     goes solely to the exercise of the Recorder's discretion.  We see no basis upon which
                     that judgment could, arguably, be impugned.  Fifth, in her directions to the jury,
                     the Recorder told them, in effect, that the applicant was accused of, and being tried
                     solely for, dangerous driving, and not any drugs offence.

                     application to extend time is refused.
