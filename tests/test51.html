                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">HMRC contends that in relation to these arrangements, the premium fee is be a fee
                        chargeable by virtue of the loan element of the arrangements, which accounts for the tax advantage expected to be obtained from using the arrangements. The arrangements here involve an amount being loaned to the user by HBC, in addition to an amount equal to the NMW being paid to the user. The purported effect of the arrangements was that the amount loaned would not be charged to income tax or national insurance contributions (“NICs”). The NMW wage element would be chargeable, if and insofar as it exceeded the individual’s personal allowance. The reduction in income tax and/or NICs is an “advantage” as defined in section 318 under sub-paragraph (a) as a reduced charge to tax which would have otherwise been payable by users.

The increase in take home pay referred to in the illustrations is a direct result of the purported
                        reduction in charge to income tax and NICs on the loan element of their earnings. Therefore,
                        it might reasonably be expected that a promoter or a person connected with a promoter of arrangements that are the same as, or substantially similar to, these arrangements, would, but for the requirements of the regulations, be able to obtain
                        a premium fee from a person experienced in receiving services of the type being provided.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This appears to be supported by the fees in fact charged. The Hamilton Bradbury<br>Companies retained up to 15% of the users’ gross contract value each pay cycle. There
                        was a<br>self-billing agreement between the Hamilton Bradbury Companies  which showed that that HBL paid 97.5% of users’ gross invoice value to HBC. HBL retained 2.5% of the gross contract value and HBC retained approximately 12.5% (having paid out the remainder to users as NMW and payments pursuant to the loan agreements).

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"> Users therefore appeared to agree to give say 90% of their taxable income generated
                        by their economic activities to HBC (allowing approximately 10% of the gross contract value to be paid as wages in line with the NMW legislation) in return for receiving around 75% of the<br>gross contract value under loan agreements, which is asserted not to be employment<br>income and so is not liable to tax or NICs. As such, the amounts withheld are paid
                        out<br>of income generated by users’ economic activities and ultimately, although indirectly, at users’ expense.

                     <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The amounts withheld by the Hamilton Bradbury Companies are determined by<br>reference to the amounts put through the scheme or, in other words, charged based<br>on users’ contract value with the end user. Since processing large sums does not call<br>for significantly more work from the Hamilton Bradbury Companies than processing<br>small sums, the amounts withheld do not reflect the amount of time, effort or risk
                        to the Hamilton Bradbury Companies. HMRC contend that the rewards which the Hamilton Bradbury
                        Companies received therefore must have been attributable to something else. The value of the amounts put through the scheme determine the amount of the tax advantage which users expected to obtain from the arrangements. As the fee is chargeable as a percentage of the contract value, the greater the amount awarded through the arrangements, the greater the expected tax saving (as tax is a percentage of earnings) and therefore the Hamilton Bradbury Companies’ cut increases in line
                        with the expected tax saving. The expected outcome of the arrangements is that users receive
                        cash payments to the value of approximately 85% of the income generated by their economic
                        activities with no, or no significant, tax or NICs either deducted and accounted for
                        or payable by their employers or by them and with no practical prospect of being required
                        to repay funds borrowed.

                        that was commonly paid at much higher rates. Nor would individuals agree to be loaned
                        money if they thought that both the money would need to be paid back and that in another
                        employment a high proportion of that loan would be paid as wages.

                        up<br>15% of their pre-tax income by agreeing to the Hamilton Bradbury Companies<br>withholding and retaining that amount. The amount withheld shows the size of fee that<br>could have been obtained and that is only attributable to the tax advantage to which<br>the transactions purportedly give rise.

                        from UK agencies on behalf of users, issued full VAT invoices to HBC in relation to
                        the amounts HBL owed HBC (which it was required to settle by paying HBC in return
                        for the services users<br>provided to end users in their capacity as HBC employees) and transferred the above
                        funds to HBC. Without HBL’s involvement the income received would not reach HBC and
                        be paid to the end users. The issuing of invoices to agencies is therefore crucial
