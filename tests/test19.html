                     in the event of them subsequently leaving the employment of IP Solutions Group Limited
                     (“<b>the Company</b>”), the newly incorporated company which acquired their shareholdings in IPS UK and
                     in which they each acquired a 30% holding of C Class Shares and became the Company’s
                     CEO and Sales Director respectively.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Their principal complaint is that the Firm failed to warn them that the terms of the
                     Transaction were such that even if they were subsequently wrongfully dismissed from
                     their employment by the Company, so that they would be classed as “Good Leavers” for
                     the purposes of the resulting sale of their shareholdings in the Company, they would
                     receive no or only nominal value for their shareholding.   That is because of the
                     impact of something called the Redemption Premium Provision (“<b>the RPP</b>”) on the determination of the “Market Value” of their shareholdings, upon them leaving
                     the Company, in accordance with the Company’s Articles.  Their pleaded case is that,
                     had they been made aware of this risk, they would have sought to have negotiated a
                     care-out of the RPP from the determination of Market Value. The true construction
                     of the relevant article was key to the decision of the High Court in the litigation
                     between the Claimants and the Company, mentioned next, and it is now central to the
                     present proceedings between the Claimants and the Firm.  The Claimants say that, had
                     they been warned that the RPP would or could have had that impact, then they would
                     either (1) have negotiated a carve-out in the Articles, such that the RPP did not
                     apply to the determination of Market Value (“<b>Scenario 1</b>”); or (2) concluded an agreement with an alternative investor (“<b>Scenario 2</b>”).  Either way, they say that they have each suffered a loss of between £1.7 and
                     £1.9 million.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In addition, they seek to recover the costs of what has been described as “<b>the Leaver Litigation</b>” in the sum of £895,141.63. The Leaver Litigation arose out of the dismissal of Mr
                     Richards and Mr Purves from their employment by the Company in July 2015.  They were
                     categorised by their employer as “Bad Leavers” for the purposes of the resulting sale
                     of their shareholdings, which, if a correct categorisation, meant that under the Articles
                     each shareholding was only worth £1.  They challenged that categorisation in the Leaver
                     Litigation brought against the Company.  Following a trial earlier that month, by
                     her judgment dated 22 July 2016, Mrs Justice May DBE, determined that they had been
                     wrongfully dismissed (“<b>the Liability Judgment</b>”: [2016] EWHC 1835 (QB)). The result meant that the Claimants ought to have been
                     categorised as Good Leavers.  On that basis they claimed to be entitled to receive
                     "Market Value" for their shares.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, by a further judgment dated 30 November 2016 (“<b>the Quantum Judgment</b>”: [2016] EWHC 2599 (QB)), following a hearing on 5 September 2016 and further written
                     submissions thereafter, May J ruled that they were only entitled to receive a nominal
                     sum for their shares. This was because of what the judge held to be the application
                     of the RPP to their disposal.  As a result, their shares were denuded of value just
                     as if they had been Bad Leavers.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Company sought to appeal the Liability Judgment but its paper application for
                     permission was unsuccessful. The Claimants obtained permission to appeal the Quantum
                     Judgment.  However, their appeal and the Company’s renewed, oral application for permission
                     to appeal the Liability Judgment were both compromised on 15 January 2018 and by consent
                     both intended appeals were dismissed.  The Claimants were each paid the sum of £87,500
                     under the compromise.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After the Claimants had completely severed their connection with it by that compromise,
                     the Company was put into liquidation on 19 December 2018 and dissolved on 19 October
                     2019.  It was insolvent and there was no distribution to its members.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Firm defended the negligence claim by reference to liability, causation, and quantum.
                     Part of its defence rests upon the contention that the Quantum Judgment was wrong
                     as the RPP did not apply in a Good Leaver scenario.  The Firm said that May J erred
                     in reaching the conclusion she did and may have done so because of an incorrect concession
                     made by the Claimants that a forced transfer constituted a “<i>Share Sale</i>” for the purposes of article 13.3.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In relation to the Firm’s duty of care, that the risk against which it is alleged
                           Firm should have warned was not a substantial one requiring such a warning.  It is
                           said to be a risk which eventuated only because of a most unlikely combination of
                           factors: a situation in which (a) both the private equity house behind the December
                           2014 purchase (“<b>Livingbridge</b>”) and the independent Chairman, Mr Andrew Lockwood (“<b>Mr Lockwood</b>”) decided they should summarily dismiss the Claimants on what they considered to
                           be justified grounds; (b) the Claimants were then held by May J to be Good Leavers;
                           (c) the court construed the Company’s Articles incorrectly; and (d) the value of the
                           Company (on the Claimants’ case) was such that it would have made a material difference
                           to the price received by them.  The Firm says that chain of events was not one that
                           could have been foreseen during the negotiation of the Transaction.

                           between the Claimants and their corporate finance advisers Knight Corporate Finance
                           Limited (“<b>Knight</b>”) and Livingbridge in September 2014.  The Firm was not party to those discussions
                           and was neither asked nor required to advise on the commercial desirability of the
                           deal.  It says that the commercial aspects were addressed by the Claimants with the
                           assistance of Mr Paul Billingham (“<b>Mr Billingham</b>”) and Ms Laura Cockburn (“<b>Ms Cockburn</b>”) of Knight.

                           Livingbridge would have agreed to carve out the RPP from a Good Leaver scenario. 
                           The Claimants would most likely have done the same deal with Livingbridge as the one
                           they actually did conclude.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Alternatively, if Livingbridge had been prepared to agree to the proposed carve out
                           (Scenario 1), it would have made no difference, both because (a) the Market Value
                           of the Claimants’ shareholdings in the Company as at 29 July 2015 was zero, and (b)
                           even if the Claimants had obtained a judgment against the Company, they would not
                           have recovered more than they did under the compromise of the appeals in the Leaver
                           Litigation because, by the conclusion of that litigation, the Company was effectively
                           insolvent.  On the scenario of the Claimants walking away from the Transaction had
                           they been warned of the risk (Scenario 2) then (a) the chance of them concluding a
                           deal with an alternative investor was low, and (b) the amount that they would have
                           received would not have exceeded the cash consideration that they received from the
                           Transaction, so that they suffered no loss.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The claim for the costs of the Leaver Litigation overlooks the point that the main
                           issue in that litigation was whether or not the Claimants were Bad Leavers.  That
                           issue had nothing to do with the alleged breaches of duty by the Firm and/or was outside
                           the scope of any such duty.  Further, most of those costs were recovered from the
                           Company, so even if the claim was otherwise good only a small fraction of the costs
                           would therefore be recoverable.

                     as to the meaning of legal documents which are the subject matter of the solicitor’s
                     retainer.  The Firm says that the court’s earlier misinterpretation of the Company’s
                     Articles in 2016 presented a risk which should not be regarded as a material or significant
                     one when viewed from the perspective of the Firm performing its retainer in 2014.

                     Firm (then the First Defendant) to act for the Claimants.  Indicative fees and a proposed
                     scope of work were set out by the Firm on 21 July 2014.  The following day Livinbridge
                     sent draft Heads of Terms to Knight and, in late July and in the context of the Claimants
                     confirming the Firm would be instructed but before it had been formally retained,
                     Mr Adam Crossley of the Firm (“<b>Mr Crossley</b>”) had provided some advice on the leaver provisions in the draft terms.  The Firm’s

                     and 26.5% equity ‘above hurdle’ in IPS Group.  The remaining equity would be held

                     would be a ‘ratchet’ whereby Livingbridge would receive a preferential distribution
                     below a multiple of its investment. In short, the agreement was that the Livingbridge
                     loan notes would carry a variable “redemption premium” such that, on a qualifying
                     sale of shares in the Company which led to the purchaser acquiring more than 50% of

                     Essentially, the RPP in article 13.3 provided that on an “<i>Exit</i>” the Livingbridge Investors were to receive the Proceeds of Sale up to the value

                     was handed down on 22 July 2016.  The Claimants had conceded that their conduct in
                     relation to the bonuses and expenses were breaches of duties owed to the Company.
                     However, the complexity of Spur 57 meant that their breach in relation to the Q1 bonus
                     was an unwitting one.  In relation to expenses, there had again been a breach but
                     there was no question of dishonesty or bad faith and that they had acted inadvertently
                     was not even contested.   The judge therefore held that those breaches were “…<i>not so significant</i>…” as to amount to gross misconduct or otherwise justify summary dismissal.  She entirely
                     rejected the Company’s second ground for dismissal, the supposed making of threats
                     to act contrary to the interests of the Company.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Claimants’ skeleton argument on the point highlighted (with my emphasis) that
                     the hypothetical basis of the article 18.4.1 <i>valuation</i> was one of a sale of the entire issued share capital of the Company on which the
                     hypothetical purchaser had no concern in the <i>distribution</i> of the purchase monies as between the sellers of different classes of shares, namely
                     the impact of the RPP under article 13.   Nor would the hypothetical willing buyer
                     of <i>the entire issued share capital</i> (i.e. all classes of share) be subsequently concerned about the impact of the RPP
                     on any later sale by him.  The Claimants pointed out that the value of a Good Leaver’s
                     shares under article 18.4.1 is the proportion of the total value that is represented
                     by his portion of the entire issued share capital.  As a fall-back argument they said
                     that, even if valuation is to be of the transfer only of the Good Leaver’s shares,
                     there was nothing in article 18.4.1 which required an assumption that article 13.3
                     should apply.  Article 13.3 (the RPP) applied only on a “<i>Share Sale</i>” (which, as I have noted, could be of less than the entire share capital provided
                     it involved the purchaser acquiring a “<i>Controlling Interest</i>”).  The skeleton argument said: “<i>In the absence of a requirement that the valuation assume that there is a Share Sale,
                        it should not do so. Of course, in fact there has been no sale of any interest in
                        any shares, but a transfer of shares back to the Company</i>.”  It went on to make points about the commercial absurdity of the Company’s contrary
                     contention.

                     valuation of the Claimants’ shares pursuant to article 18.4.1.  Mr Nicholls had not
                     at that stage been asked to determine their Market Value.  His letter was written

                     had any relevance to the determination of Market Value.  The Claimants said he had
                     misconstrued the effect of article 18.4 and that this amounted to a “<i>manifest error</i>” for the purposes of the article.

                              necessarily includes a recognition of the type of shares held by the Leaver. The Claimants

                              clear: the expert is called upon to determine market value of the “Leaver’s shares”.
                              There is no provision directing that the type or class of share is to be disregarded
                              in that process, in circumstances where the Articles clearly contemplated that a “Leaver”
                              might hold any one or more of many different classes of shares. As [the Company’s
                              counsel] rightly submitted, Article 13.3 was a clause designed to protect LB’s investment
                              by effectively subordinating the realisable value of classes of shares other than
                              those held by the LB investors. To leave that circumstance out of account in assessing
                              the market value of those other shares would in my view be contrary to commonsense,
                              given the purpose of the clause, and would require explicit provision. It is significant,
                              in this respect, that Article 18.4 does include explicit provision for ignoring the
                              circumstance of a particular bundle of shares being a minority shareholding or subject
                              to compulsory transfer requirements, but not for their being shares of a class impacted

                              within the definition of “a share sale”</b>, but at that point what Article 13.3 does is it tells the sellers how they are to
                           distribute the monies between themselves. For the purchaser, the purchaser determining
                           the value of the company has no interest at all in what happens to the money that
                           it pays to the sellers and that’s an internal matter. But in fixing the valuation
                           of the entire share capital, then Article 13.3 just isn’t relevant to the purchaser.
                           The purchaser is going to get the entire share capital and therefore it isn’t taking
                           shares which have some way a lesser value, lesser potential future value.

                           to it, which is that what the valuer has to do is value the entire share capital.
                           They have to look at the entirety. What the EY approach does (or the defendant’s approach
                           does) is it adds a further stage, which is to say the market value has to take into
                           account the fact that a specific type of share is going to be acquired by the purchaser,
                           but that isn’t the exercise, the hypothetical exercise, which is being required by
                           18.4, which is that you have to reach a market value as if all of the shares were
                           being sold at the same time. So the purchaser gets all of the shares; they can do
                           what they like with them, they can vary the Articles; they have a completely free
                           hand because they get the entire share capital and that’s what they are buying. So
                           the value of the shares would be unencumbered by Article 13.3. That is there to deal
                           only with the distribution of the monies as between the sellers.

                           held by a leaver (the definition is on page 42); all of the shares held by a leaver.
                           It therefore is saying exactly what you suggested it might say in the alternative;
                           a longer form way would be that part of the shares that the leaver holds at the time
                           it was set. It is not specifically saying… if that were the approach, then it would
                           be completely unnecessary to put in as if the entire issued share capital of the company
                           were being sold because if you were only to look at the specific value of the specific
                           leaver’s shares as at the date of their departure, then it is completely irrelevant
                           what the valuation of the entire share (<b>inaudible</b>) would be. And it is precisely there where a purchaser would say, “Actually these
                           shares are worth nothing to me because there is a redemption premium on them, which
                           means that I’m not going to be able to do anything with them for some time.” So it
                           is the insertion rather than the identification between the shares which is simply
                           a shorthand way of saying (<b>several inaudible words</b>), which obviously is at the crux of this. It ignores though the importance of the
                           words “as if the entire (<b>inaudible</b>) of the company were being sold”. There is no meaning to those words; they are simply
                           superfluous on the EY defendant approach.

                              are only 30 per cent, so I don’t feel comfortable just attributing 30 per cent of

                     class of share held by the Leaver), when the assumption was that all of the Company’s
                     shares were being sold, was rejected.  This was because the valuation was to be of
                     “<i>the Leaver’s Shares</i>” and (those being Class C Shares in the present case) there was no disapplication
                     of article 13.3 alongside the other three “disregards” mentioned at the conclusion
                     of article 18.4.1.

                     Firm admitted that neither Mr Crossley nor anyone else from the Firm advised the Claimants
                     that the RPP would apply to the Leaver Provisions or that there was a risk it would
                     apply.  The Response said that it was the Firm’s case that the RPP does not apply
                     to the Leaver Provisions and challenged the underlying assumption that the Articles
                     could properly be interpreted in that way.  It referred back to the Defence (paragraphs
                     22, 24, 48.1 and 49.1(c)) for the averment that Mr Crossley drew the Claimants’ attention
                     to the RPP and that it was clear that the Claimants were fully aware of it.  It went
                     on to say that May J only held as she did because of the Claimants’ failure to argue
                     before her that Article 13.3 was concerned with the distribution of Proceeds of Sale
                     received from third party purchasers.

                     RPP in the Good Leaver scenario, such language would not have been accepted by Livingbridge
                     and therefore not included in the Articles.  As an alternative, the Firm says that
                     the Leaver Litigation would still have come about and, by the end of it, the Company
                     was in a parlous financial position and would not have been able to pay the Market
                     Value of the Claimants’ shares.  The Firm denies responsibility for the greater part
                     of the costs of that earlier litigation when the circumstances giving rise to it had
                     nothing to do with advice given, or not given, by it.  As noted in the Introduction,
                     the Leaver Litigation is also the basis of the Firm’s defence of contributory fault
                     which rests upon the Claimants’ conduct in bringing about their dismissal and the
                     part they are said to have played in causing May J to reach the wrong conclusion in
                     the Quantum Judgment.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Scenario 2 is challenged on the basis that the Transaction with Livingbridge was the
                     only credible way by which the Claimants could achieve their commercial objectives.
                     The Firm says the only other credible buyer was GCI, a trade buyer, whose purchase
                     would have seen the Claimants leave the business altogether when that was not their
                     plan.

                     that, even without the impact of the RPP, the Market Value of their shares would have
                     been nil because the amount outstanding under the Livingbridge loan notes meant there
                     was no value in the Company’s equity.  On Scenario 2, the Firm denies that the Claimants
                     lost value beyond the cash received for their shares in IPS UK under the Transaction.

                     to make the case as complicated as possible.  He gave as examples the Firm’s argument
                     that the decision in the Quantum Judgment came about because of the way in which the
                     point about the RPP was argued in front of May J and how fanciful it was that the

                     the Claimants’ opening and closing submissions running to a total of 34 pages (with
                     a decent number of cross-references to the trial bundle) and the Firm’s comprising
                     over 100 (with considerably greater cross-referencing).  However, each set was a model
                     of its type and I have found all four documents to be of great assistance in marshalling
                     my thoughts upon the many issues raised.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The case is a convoluted one.  Reflecting upon this lengthy judgment has confirmed
                     its complexity in terms of the number of issues which the Firm is entitled to raise
                     (in the sense of there being a point of substance to be addressed) in resisting liability
                     to the Claimants.  The above represents the barest outline of the Defence.  On my
                     rough-and-ready count, the Firm’s points on liability, causation and loss involve
                     it placing about 8 or 9 main hurdles in the way of the claim.  Most of those embody
                     more than one hindrance for the Claimants and more than one requires the correctness
                     of the Quantum Judgment to be re-visited.  The issues of loss have prompted extensive
                     expert evidence and the need for separate analysis of the claim in respect of legal
                     fees.  Even if the Claimants complete the circuit to success, the Firm seeks to devalue
                     their prize with its two points about the Claimants’ contributory fault.  All of this
                     means there are a lot of points to be decided by a reference to a substantial amount
                     of documentary, expert and witness evidence.

                     RPP either did apply to the valuation of a Good Leaver’s shares is obviously at odds
                     with what they argued before May J, which is that article 13.3 had no impact upon
                     the valuation process under article 18.4.1.  Mr Leiper QC rightly said that he had
                     no embarrassment, now the duly compromised Quantum Judgment has cast the die against
                     his clients, in backing the reasoning of the judge.  Indeed, as I shall explain he
                     deployed one further argument on construction which, he said, would have strengthened
                     the Company’s argument in support of her conclusion. However,  Mr Tozzi QC highlighted
                     this point when submitting the duty upon the Firm should not be fixed with the benefit
                     of hindsight; and that it was no part of that duty to advise that the court might
                     misconstrue the articles in a way previously argued against by the Claimants.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Against that, Mr Leiper QC in his opening referred to the position which Livingbridge
                     adopted on the point in the Leaver Litigation.  He drew my attention to a witness
                     statement of Mr Morris (made in the Leaver Litigation) which expressed in quite trenchant
                     terms Livinbridge’s position that the RPP would apply to the valuation of a Good Leaver’s
                     shares.  He also highlighted the position adopted by the Company’s solicitors, DMH
                     Stallard LLP, when engaging with the Claimants’ then solicitors, Clyde &amp; Co LLP, in
                     the Leaver Litigation over the impact of the RPP.  I return to the Company’s stated
                     understanding of the impact of the RPP on the valuation under article 18.4.1 when
                     addressing the question of liability.

                     (at least on the issue of causation) by the Firm saying that Livingbridge would not
                     have been prepared to re-negotiate terms with the Claimants so that the Articles expressly
                     stipulated that the RPP should not apply to the valuation of the Leaver’s shares.
                     He therefore pointed to the tension within the Firm’s case as to whether or not (without
                     such express clarification to the contrary) the RPP did apply in that situation.

                     that it was under no duty to advise the Claimants that the RPP applied on the valuation
                     under article 18.4.1, when the Firm says it did not apply, I am required to determine
                     this point afresh for the purposes of the present claim.

                     the other points summarised above to say that the risk which in fact materialised
                     for the Claimants, and which led to their shareholdings in the Company being held
                     to only nominal value, was not one in respect of which there was any negligent failure

                     Judgment, the Claimants nevertheless point to her ladyship’s contrary view in saying
                     that the Firm was under a duty to advise upon <i>the risk</i> that a court might conclude the RPP was to be taken into account in the determination
                     of Market Value. The Claimants’ reliance upon this risk as the basis of their allegation
                     of negligence sits more easily with their position in the Leaver Litigation that the
                     judge’s interpretation of the Articles was wrong.  That risk did in fact materialise,
                     whether or not another judge like me would have accepted the Claimant’s position and
                     reached the opposite conclusion to May J.

                     earlier position on the interpretation of the Articles) which is to the effect that,
                     had the Firm advised the Claimants upon the risk, it would have been a litigation
                     risk that the Claimants would have been prepared to accept as the price of concluding
                     the Transaction and/or a risk that, once highlighted in pre-completion negotiations,
                     Livingbridge would not have agreed to eliminate by agreeing an appropriate revision

                     Scenario 1 (proceeding with the Transaction having agreed with Livingbridge that the
                     RPP was to be disapplied on the valuation under article 18.4.1) but they recognised
                     that the thrust of their evidence at trial supported Scenario 2: that they would have
                     walked away from the Transaction (in the face of Livingbridge not being prepared to
                     agree the point) and proceeded with a different transaction with an alternative investor.

                     (2) without the impact of the RPP.  The Firm gave no warranty that the RPP had no
                     impact upon the valuation under article 18.4.1.  Instead, the case on loss rests upon
                     those two alternative and hypothetical scenarios which arise on the assumption that

                     for loss of a chance caused by the defendant’s professional negligence.  Lord Briggs

                     of probabilities, and those to be addressed by reference to the assessment of the
                     value of the lost opportunity.  Like the present case, <i>Allied Maples</i> involved a claim to recover damages for loss, caused by the defendant solicitors’
                     negligence, of the opportunity to achieve a more favourable outcome in a negotiated

He distinguished that from “<i>the most optimistic non-negligent advice that could have been given</i>” for the purpose of assessing what the claimants would have done had their barrister
                     given the most likely non-negligent advice about the prospects of successfully defending
                     a judicial review (of the grant of planning permission to them) with more detailed
                     evidence of prejudice.  Morgan J compared the chance of success actually enjoyed by
                     the claimants with the chance of success determined by the most likely non-negligent
                     advice and concluded, on the facts, that the difference between the two could not
                     be said to be more than 5 to 10 per cent.  That was a negligible improvement which

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Applying <i>Perry v Raleys</i>, the claimant first has to prove on the balance of probabilities that he would have
                     taken any necessary steps required of him to convert the receipt of competent advice
                     into some financial (or financially measurable) advantage.  In the case of negligent
                     advice given by a solicitor to the client, the taking of some positive step by the
                     client, once in receipt of competent advice, is an essential (although not necessarily
                     sufficient) element in the chain of causation.  For this reason there is no reason
                     why either party to the negligence proceedings should be deprived of the full benefit
                     of an adversarial trial of that issue which, as Lord Briggs explained, will give rise
                     to an all or nothing outcome.  If the claimant proves upon the narrowest balance of
                     probability that he would have taken that step then he suffers no discount in the
                     value of the claim by reason of the substantial possibility that he might not have
                     done so.  If he fails, however narrowly, to prove that he would have taken the requisite
                     step, he gets nothing on account of the less than 50% chance that he might have done
                     so.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">If, however, the claimant does discharge the burden of proof upon him at that first
                     stage, in relation to what he would have done, there is no trial within a trial on
                     the second stage of evaluating the lost chance.  As Lord Briggs explained, at [20],
                     “<i>[T]o the extent that the supposed beneficial outcome depends upon what others would
                        have done, this depends upon a loss of chance evaluation</i>”.  At this second stage the claimant must establish that he has lost a real or substantial
                     chance. Where causation is dependent upon the acts of a third party such as Livingbridge,
                     the balance of probabilities test does not apply and instead he <i>“…must prove as a matter of causation that he has a real or substantial chance…”</i> that the third party would have acted as the claimant contends: per Stuart-Smith
                     LJ in <i>Allied Maples</i> v <i>Simmons &amp; Simmons</i>  at p.1614D.   The quantification of the “loss of a chance” is an “<i>evaluative judgment</i>” for the Court: see <i>Wellesley Partners LLP</i> v <i>Withers LLP</i> [2016] Ch 529 at [125] per Floyd LJ.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Where this exercise involves evaluating multiple chances, the approach to be taken
                     depends upon whether or not those chances are independent or interdependent.  Independent
                     chances are multiplied together to generate a final figure, as Bryan J explained in
                     <i>AssetCo plc</i> v <i>Grant Thornton UK LLP</i> [2019] Bus LR 2291, at [432]-[448].  Where the contingencies are interdependent (or
                     overlapping), a multiplicative approach is not appropriate; and the Court will need
                     to make an evaluative judgment as to the overall figure: see <i>AssetCo</i> v <i>GT</i> at [421]-[431].

                     They said there was no doubt that the consequences of their catastrophic falling out
                     with Livingbridge (and Mr Lockwood) and of the Quantum Judgment created in the Claimants’
                     minds a profound and deep-seated grievance against the Firm.  They no doubt now feel
                     that they were not protected against a risk that led to them losing their equity in
                     a business that they believe was worth £10 million, or perhaps even more, at the date
                     of the Transaction, and which would have gone on to be worth many times that value.
                     However, the claim against the Firm had to be looked at dispassionately and without
                     the benefit of hindsight: see <i>Reeves v Thrings &amp; Long </i>(paragraph 117 above).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In parallel with that point, the Firm criticised the adequacy of the witness statements
                     of Mr Richards and Mr Purves which were said in its closing submissions to have been
                     prepared “<i>either in large part or exclusively from memory with minimal or no reference to the
                        contemporaneous documentation</i>”.  Mr Tozzi QC made a particular criticism of Mr Richards that, having initially
                     set out his recollection of events for the purpose of preparing his witness statement,
                     unaided by contemporaneous documents, he then subsequently referred only to 7 documents
                     for  the purpose of checking the accuracy of that recollection. Mr Purves had referred
                     to none.  When asked about this, he pointed to the relatively recent date of his witness
                     statement in circumstances where he had read many documents, many times, over the
                     course of the present litigation and the Leaver Litigation. Mr Purves’ evidence was
                     described by the Firm as “<i>slapdash</i>”.

                     position.  For example, Mr Purves’ statement began with a reference to the Firm acting
                     on the sale of “<i>my 30% stake</i>” in IPS UK “<i>our remaining shares (totalling a 60% share in the [the Company]) becoming worthless</i>.” Obviously, that was not a correct analysis of the Transaction.

                     which led to them being described as unreliable witnesses in the Firm’s closing submissions.
                     In <i>Gestmin</i>, at [20], Leggatt J referred to the “<i>considerable interference</i>” with witness memory which resulted from what was then the procedure of preparing
                     a witness for trial, as often as not when (as in the present case) a long time has
                     already elapsed since the relevant events. He referred to the process beginning with
                     initial draft by the lawyer and the statement being made, possibly following a number
                     of re-drafts, after the witness’s memory has been “refreshed” by reading the documents
                     (including the court documents and other argumentative material as well as documents
                     which the witness did not see at the time).   All of this has now changed with the
                     introduction of Practice Direction 57AC.

                     the Statement of Best Practice in the Practice Direction.  The suggestion that their
                     accounts of events should have been guided more firmly by the contemporaneous documents
                     is one which smacks of reverting to the practice deprecated in <i>Gestmin</i> at potential cost to the honest account of matters known personally to them which
                     it was their duty to give.  Greater reference by them to such documentation would
                     almost certainly have resulted in a substantial expansion of their written evidence-in-chief
                     even if it highlighted only the key aspects identified in the lengthy Sections B,
                     C and D of this judgment. It would also have carried with it a significant risk of
                     “leading questions” (defined in the Practice Direction to cover not just putting words
                     into the mouth but also information into the mind) undermining their personal account
                     of matters.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Leiper QC made a number of observations about the absence of evidence from Mr Crossley.
                     One was that it meant that the court had been deprived of value of what Leggatt J
                     in <i>Gestmin</i>, at [22], ascribed to "<i>the opportunity that cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to
                        scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness</i>".  Mr Leiper said it was surprising that the disclosure contained no file notes of
                     conversations with the Claimants save for one at the beginning of the retainer (and
                     from which it was unclear whether Mr Crossley’s thoughts, or the content of one or
                     more meetings or calls, or a mix of all these).  He also made the forceful points
                     that the Claimants had no opportunity to test Mr Crossley on his understanding of
                     the suggested distinction between a commercial risk and a legal risk and that the
                     court has no idea of what Mr Crossley himself understood the RPP to mean. Mr Leiper
                     observed that, as it is the Firm’s case that the RPP was a commercial agreement and
                     that the Articles simply reflected that deal, with Livingbridge expressing in the
                     Leaver Litigation the firm view that the RPP applied to any form of exit from the
                     business and that the Claimants should have appreciated as much, it would be entirely
                     proper to infer that Mr Crossley might also have assumed the same.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, I do accept the Firm’s criticism of that part of Mr Richards’ evidence which
                     did appear to involve reconstruction of events, in hindsight, which involved Mr Lockwood
                     pursuing his own agenda in supporting his and Mr Purves’ removal from the Company.
                     There was no evidence to support that and it is inconsistent with the findings of
                     May J.  The judge rejected the idea that Livingbridge had laid a “<i>bear trap</i>” for the Claimants, though she did conclude that, once their removal from the Company
                     was on the agenda,  Livingbridge and Mr Lockwood had begun to perceive relevant events
                     through that lens.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The principal points put to Mr Richards in cross-examination by Mr Tozzi QC were (1)
                     the Claimants’ reliance upon Knight and Mr Howitt when deciding in 2014 to favour
                     the Livingbridge bid over one made by the potential trade buyer GCI : (2) their further
                     reliance upon those advisers (but not the Firm) to agree with Livingbridge upon the
                     Leaver Provisions so far as the exit value of their shareholdings in the Company were
                     concerned and the debate about them was concluded before the Firm was instructed;
                     (3) the lack of reality behind Mr Richards’ view that, allowing for the cash received
                     under the Transaction, he and Mr Purves were rolling over the remaining value of a
                     business which they considered to be worth around £10m, in the form of equity in the
                     Company, when their respective shareholdings in the Company were treated by them as
                     having a value of £90,000.

                              of nearly every conversation we had with Adam. Pretty much at the end of every meeting
                              or call that Keith was involved in he would ask: "Adam, tell me how we're going to

                              start again". I also expressed my concerns along similar lines and I remember that
                              we negotiated gross misconduct being redefined to a narrow range of things because
                              we wanted to mitigate this risk as much as possible as well (from being something
                              frivolous to an actual proved event). I wanted to make sure that my remaining 30%
                              shareholding in the holding company were absolutely going to be worth something to

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Firm suggested that the evidence Mr Richards gave in cross-examination about having
                     discussions with Mr Crossley about “the leaver provisions” in September 2014, after
                     Heads of Terms had been agreed with Livingbridge, was unreliable evidence.  I do not
                     accept that.  I understood Mr Richards to be talking as much about the restrictive
                     covenants as the so-called vesting rights, that would bind him upon leaving, and the
                     interaction between those covenants and the value of those rights.   He referred to
                     continuing discussion with Mr Crossley on this aspect “<i>because it was all tied in together</i>.”

                     on 13 November 2014 on the subject of “restrictive covenants”.  Mr Richards’ view
                     at the time was that they should not be subject to restrictive covenants on leaving
                     the Company if they received less than £400,000 each for their shares.  When asked
                     about this, he said:

                              to be remote, given that the business had a value of £10 million and we had 30 per

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Tozzi QC was able to point to certain inaccuracies in Mr Purves’ witness statement,
                     most obviously that in the first paragraph he referred to the loss as a result of
                     the sale of his “<i>30% stake</i>” in IPS UK when, of course, he had sold all of his shares in that company in return
                     for both cash and a fresh shareholding in the Company.  Referring also to the fact
                     that Mr Purves appeared not to have refreshed his memory by reference to any of the
                     contemporaneous documents before signing it, Mr Tozzi said that Mr Purves’ witness
                     statement indicated a slapdash approach to the facts.

                     complaint against the Firm is concerned.  Mr Purves’ subsequent answers revealed that
                     he accepted the proper analysis of the Transaction but he also said “<i>I had 30 per cent of the new business</i>” and “[<i>i]t's relating here to the 30 per cent that I lost in the new business</i>” and “<i>I understand that to read that I lost 30 per cent when I was wrongly dismissed in
                        the new firm</i>”.  The issue over the EBITDA multiple to be implied from the terms of the Transaction
                     (which I address below in the context of the expert evidence) perhaps lends some support
                     to Mr Purves’ broad brush but technically inaccurate way of looking at the Transaction.

                     Firm’s offices attended by Livingbridge.  Mr Tozzi suggested that any assurances about
                     the security of their position within the Company would have come instead from Mr
                     Howitt and from Knight.  Mr Purves responded:

                           many occasions, and I used to ask Adam every time we met, and to the point he used
                           to smile at me in the end because I'd asked him so many times "Tell me" -- excuse
                           my language -- "how I'm gonna get fucked because I'm 50 years old, I've worked 13
                           years in this business, this is my daughter's inheritance. This business, myself and

                           wrong? Give me the worst-case scenario." And I asked it so many times, and he used
                           to smile at me and say, "Keith, relax, there's only bad leaver provisions here. You're
                           not going to do any of those." I said, "No, I'm not gonna do any of those that are

                     Mr Purves quickly accepted Mr Crossley had not done so.  However, that does not mean
                     that Mr Purves’ evidence about him generally signalling the worst case scenario is
                     to be rejected.  I accept that evidence.  Of course, there is no claim against the

                     his evidence supports the case for saying that the financial implications of the Leaver

                     bidders (in particular GCI) in 2014.  It will be necessary to revert to this below
                     when considering the Claimants’ case on causation under Scenario 2.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Billingham explained that in 2014 the technology and telecoms sector was one in
                     which the interest of private equity firms was relatively new.  Knight had not then
                     done a private equity deal.  The idea of doing such a deal, as opposed to one with
                     a trade buyer, would have been his.  He explained that Ms Cockburn’s professional
                     background had been in private equity.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Billingham recognised that the sending out of a teaser document in early 2014 had
                     not generated a great number of expressions of interest (through requests for an information
                     pack) but said that he did not feel particularly disappointed by that.  He said that
                     there was a lot of interest in information technology businesses at the time but that
                     IPS UK was of a smaller scale than many of them.  He also explained that the level
                     of interest in a potential acquisition is to a large extent dependent upon timing
                     and whether or not a potential purchaser or investor might already be tied up pursuing
                     another transaction.

Having accepted that Knight would
                     probably need to verify some of those on the list a little further, he said this in
                     response to the suggestion that he would not have left any realistic potential buyers

                              you think is a right buyer for a business but it's not just the right time because

                     general point about the interest of particular potential buyers being sensitive to
                     timing was borne out by what he said about Knight’s dealings with GCI in 2014. He
                     also explained that another private equity firm included on his initial list, BGF,
                     had already invested in GCI and had said they did not want to be conflicted.  Knight
                     reported in May 2014 that BGF were “<i>considering through GCI only</i>.”

                     up to 6x EBITDA plus an earn-out; (3) Intercity at up to 5x EBITDA;  and (4) Adept
                     at 5x EBITDA.  He explained that the multipliers were of an EBITDA of approximately
                     £0.94m, adding <i>“[H]owever, during this process the actual run rate EBITDA increased to c£1.2m, which
                        increased the value of the four respective offers</i>.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In testimony, Mr Billingham explained that by early May 2014 the interest in IPS UK
                     was limited to that of GCI, Livingbridge and Maven who had also made an outline offer
                     of 5x EBITDA.  However, Maven was not regarded as competitive and by June only Livingbridge
                     and GCI were in contention.  He said “<i>it would have been nice to have at least one other strong private equity offer</i>” but explained that, at the time, the business of IPS UK was at the smaller end of
                     the market from the perspective of private equity interest.

                     deal but, in any event and confirming the view he expressed in the contemporaneous
                     correspondence, said that Knight clearly favoured the offer from Livingbridge.  Mr
                     Billingham clarified that the offer from Livingbridge involved a higher multiplier
                     of EBITDA (7.5x) because it had by then become the practice of private equity firms
                     to offer a higher value for shareholdings on the basis they would enjoy a priority
                     over any later sale proceeds from the business under loan notes held by them.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">So far as GCI was concerned, Mr Billingham did harbour doubts about GCI being a credible
                     buyer of IPS UK.  This was because “<i>it would have been their first sizeable transaction since the BGF investment</i>.”   However, his evidence was that Mr Wayne Martin (the CEO of GCI) remained keen.
                     He rejected the suggestion that BGF (a substantial minority shareholder in GCI) would
                     not have been keen on the purchase of IPS UK, saying:

                              the time. So he was still the senior party, but obviously BGF would have had consent

                              think Wayne had brought them into the process at that stage because they were looking

                              deal, so we had a bit more time anyway, there was no rush for GCI.</i>”

                     and Mr Howitt in which he reported that GCI “<i>are trying to close a deal in the next 2 weeks and then IPS will become their priority</i>.”  On 7 July 2014 he reported that he had spoken to Mr Martin who had told him that
                     the completion of GCI’s other deal had slipped to late July.  Mr Billingham accepted
                     that the meeting with BGF that Mr Martin had suggested to him did not take place and
                     that matters thereafter slipped with GCI because of their other deal and the decision

                     explained how, by early May 2014 and using the forecasts in the Information Memorandum
                     (and EBITDA of approximately £0.94m), GCI were proposing an initial consideration
                     of £4m, deferred consideration of £1m in GCI shares (conditional upon the EBITDA being
                     maintained at completion of the deal) and an earnout to be measured at the end of
                     2 years on the basis that the EBITDA would be multiplied 6x and the two cash payments
                     would then be deducted.  The net earnout payment would be as to the first £2m in cash,
                     the next £4m in GCI shares (valued at 10x EBITDA) and any balance in cash.

                     shares, Mr Billingham was concerned that might send out the wrong message to GCI and
                     sour negotiations.  The proposal that the Claimants’ shareholding should benefit from
                     a ratcheted dividend if GCI was not sold after 2 years (so that there would be a financial
                     incentive for GCI to buy them out rather than pay such a dividend) was rejected. 
                     GCI’s response was “<i>not agreed, but there is a dividend policy already in place and this will apply to
                        these shares.</i>”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The proposal also involved the Claimants continuing with their salaries of £90,000.
                     Mr Billingham pointed out that this was probably on the low side but beneficial to
                     the EBITDA on earnout “<i>because every pound of salary would have cost £6 on the earnout</i>.”  He also considered that there would be cost-saving synergies on a trade deal with
                     GCI (proposed to be split 75% to GCI and 25% to IPS UK for the purpose of EBITDA calculations)
                     and although there would not be massive synergies there would be some financially
                     beneficial ones.

                     Mr Morris and received Livingbridge’s offer letter on 25 June 2014, Mr Richards later
                     sent an email to Mr Billingham, on 27 June 2014, saying he and Mr Purves did not feel
                     able to proceed with the GCI deal as it stood (he also said the Livingbridge terms
                     were unacceptable and too weighted against them).  So far as GCI was concerned, they
                     said they would require a cash only deal, with no shares, or one where the shares
                     attracted a significant dividend until sold with a long stop date of 24 months before
                     GCI were obliged to buy them.

                     GCI over the Claimants’ suggested terms within the next fortnight with a view to then
                     commencing the due diligence process with them.  He concluded: “<i>[I]f we are unable to proceed with the GCI deal with a deal structure similar to the

                     Skeels adopted multiple of 8.2x EBITDA.  This is the midpoint of range of EBITDA multiples

                     of valuations of the equity of IPS UK of £4.1m and £6.5m.  He considered that a range
                     of multiples between 4.2x and 6.0x EBITDA was appropriate to value IPS UK as at 3
                     December 2014 based on the offers received for IPS UK in 2014.  Like Mr Skeels, he
                     used a maintainable EBITDA figure of £1.1m p.a. for his high and midpoint valuations
                     (but one of £1m for his low valuation).  He noted that his valuation was materially
                     similar to the sum of just short of the £4.6 million cash which the Claimants received
                     on 3 December 2014 pursuant to the Transaction, which he said indicated that the Claimants
                     received fair market value for their interest in IPS UK at the time of the Transaction.

                     £2.6m and £0.9m and his use of an EBITDA multiple in the range of 4.0x to 6.6x (the

                     regard the Comparable Transactions identified by Mr Skeels to be appropriate comparables

                     EBITDA multiple within it.  At the risk of gross simplification, this turned upon
                     whether, under the Transaction and in addition to £4.6m cash paid, the Claimants and
                     Mr Lindsell had received shares in the Company whose equity value at that point was
                     nil because the Company was loaded with debt (per Mr Taylor) or which had an entry
                     value of £5.7m (per Mr Skeels).  The disagreement between them does not rest upon
                     the RPP impacting upon the value of the Claimants’ shareholding in the Company: Mr
                     Taylor’s point was that the Company’s indebtedness to Livingbridge under the loan
                     notes meant that none of the shares in the Company were worth anything at the First
                     Valuation Date.  Again, Mr Skeels said that the agreement that the First Valuation
                     Date was immediately before the actual sale to Livingbridge meant that there was no
                     need to consider the value of the Company as at that date.

                     30%.  For this valuation he used Comparable Transactions (adding three and removing
                     one from the list he had used for the First Valuation Date) only as a cross-check

                     Valuation Date by measuring the impact of changes in the industry by calculating the
                     movement in the multiples obtained for comparable public companies between the First
                     Valuation Date and the Second Valuation Date.  He did this by looking at the comparable

                     and mean multiples between the First Valuation Date and the Second Valuation Date.

                     an EBITDA of £1.3m p.a..  Mr Taylor relied upon management reforecasts of July 2015
                     and September 2015 (saying the figures in the latter was based on actual figures to
                     July 2015 which would have been known to the Company).  Allowing for the deduction
                     of management costs, this produced a range of £0.6m to £0.9m p.a..  Mr Skeels said
                     (and Mr Richards’ evidence gave some support for this) that the reforecasts reflected
                     a slower revenue growth than anticipated in the first few months of 2015 and were
                     not an indication of material long term decline.  He also said that Mr Taylor had
                     incorrectly made adjustments for certain costs (in particular Livingbridge’s advisory
                     fees) which should be regarded as one-off rather than costs incurred in the normal

                           Companies, as adjusted) produced a very significantly greater value, whereas his alternative
                           Income Approach valuation actually saw its value fall.  The Firm said this made a

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Claimants’ main criticism of Mr Taylor’s approach to the valuation on the First
                     Valuation Date was that he had valued the business of IPS UK (immediately before the
                     Transaction) by reference to the structure adopted by Livingbridge to carry the Transaction
                     into effect.  This involved him ascribing a value of nil to the Company, because the
                     Company was from the outset laden with Livingbridge debt, and to feed that into his
                     valuation of business of IPS on a sale basis (i.e. debt free basis, much as I seek
                     to explain below on the quite separate analysis of article 18.4.1) prior to the Transaction.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">A closely related criticism was that Mr Taylor had misunderstood the LIM and how the
                     EBITDA multiple he derived from it – a range of 4.0x to 5.3x according to whether
                     the EBITDA was taken to be £1.2m or £0.9m - was at odds with how Livingbridge and
                     Oakley (whose draft Exit Report dated 17 October 2014 the LIM relied upon) approached
                     the valuation of IPS UK prior to the Transaction.  Mr Taylor used the range of multiples
                     implied by the Transaction (on his analysis of it) to support his conclusion that
                     4.2x to 6x was a reasonable range of multiples at the First Valuation Date.

                     low point valuation (though not his high and midpoint ones) at the First Valuation
                     Date when the CIL Report, upon which he relied in doing so, showed the figure for
                     2014 to be £1.2m.

                     confusing.  He had taken his valuation on the First Valuation Date (which they said
                     was flawed for the reasons just outlined) and then used the Comparable Companies methodology,
                     which he had previously rejected, to adjust that valuation for the passage of time.
                     They said his preferred EBITDA figure of £0.6m was contrary to the figure of £0.9m
                     which he said was “knowable” to the Company’s Board by July 2015.

                           of the Transaction supports his range of 7.7x to 8.7x (midpoint 8.2x) obtained using
                           the Market Approach.  My preference of Mr Skeels’ analysis (when he did not rely upon
                           the terms of the Transaction as the basis of his valuation at the First Valuation
                           Date but Mr Taylor did) is a significant factor in my decision to prefer generally

                     Date is too high a figure.  In my judgment, it would not have been agreed by the hypothetical
                     seller and buyer to have been as low as Mr Taylor’s £0.6m to £0.9m but the disagreement
                     between the experts, by reference to financial material available by July 2015, has
                     led me to conclude that the EBITDA for the Second Valuation Date should be £1.1m.
                     This is the mid-point between Mr Skeels’ figure and Mr Taylor’s higher figure.  It
                     is the same EBITDA as that used for IPS UK on the First Valuation Date only about
                     8 months earlier.  As I explain further below, the competing evidence over the EBITDA
                     at the Second Valuation Date, by reference to the Company’s performance in the 7 months
                     following the Transaction, has led me to conclude that it is safest to revert to the
                     consensus about what it was taken to be (for IPS UK) just before the Transaction took
                     place.

                     other indicative bids were based on EBITDA of circa £0.9m p.a. when, as Mr Billingham
                     explained, the actual run rate EBITDA increased to circa £1.2m during the offer process.

                     that in January 2016 the Company’s solicitors in the Leaver Litigation, DMH Stallard,
                     wrote to the Claimants’ then solicitors, Clyde &amp; Co, in terms designed to show that
                     the Claimants’ shareholding in the Company was worthless with or without the impact
                     of the RPP.  The solicitors set out the Company’s valuation methodology a “<i>Sector Valuation Multiple</i>” (of 7.9x which was adjusted to 7.17x to reflect a liquidity discount of 10%) which
                     was “<i>[P]er a bucket of comparable transactions subject to liquidity discount due to scale</i>”.   Mr Taylor said the underlying analysis was not clear or how it fitted with the
                     DLOM applied by Mr Skeels.  However, the range of multiples identified in the letter
                     were closer to those adopted by Mr Skeels for the Second Valuation Date than Mr Taylor’s.

                     months (“LTM”, as at that date) and no reported EBITDA for the next 12 months (“NTM”)
                     meant that an EBITDA multiple from that company was not meaningful.

                     court the benefit of his opinion on the approach to the valuation of the Claimants’
                     shares under the Articles (as I explain below in the next section of this judgment)
                     he said that, if he had been directed to value a minority stake, then he would consider
                     applying a “[<i>D]iscount for lack of control, or “minority discount”, reflecting that holders of
                        a minority parcel of shares are unable to control, amongst other things, the strategy
                        and direction of the business, as well as timing and method of exit</i>”.  As Mr Taylor accepted, Mr Skeels’ Control Premium is the inverse of such a “<b>DLOC</b>”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Taylor’s Supplemental Report (prepared after the Joint Statement) set out in some
                     detail the controversy over the routine application of a Control Premium and, referring
                     to the previous recognition of it in the US courts, said: <i>“[I]t is thus apparent that there is a strong body of opinion that control premiums
                        should not be applied unless there are very specific circumstances that justify one</i>.”   Mr Taylor recognised that “<i>when a buyer perceives that a company’s profit is not being maximised or the overall
                        value of the target can be enhanced, the buyer might be persuaded to pay a premium
                        above the established market price.</i>” His view was that control premiums only exist where the hypothetical purchaser would
                     have an opportunity to materially improve the cash flow or economic benefits generated
                     by the business and would be willing to pay for that opportunity. He said he had seen
                     no evidence that this was the case in respect of IPS UK and that a “<i>generic and universal intent</i>” on the part of the management and Livingbridge to improve the future operations
                     of the business, which is how he described the matters relied upon by Mr Skeels, was
                     not sufficient to justify one.

                     his Control Premium.  Mr Skeels said in evidence: “<i>I'm slightly puzzled because I'm using control premium to deal with the comparable
                        companies</i>.”  His Report said: <i>“[A]fter application of the DLOM and Control Premium, the Average EBITDA multiple
                        derived from Comparable Companies is 7.5x and the median is 7.8x.”</i></p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Skeels was criticised by the Firm for taking what he described as the Mazars “house
                     view” (derived from a range of 25% to 40% for Control Premium) of the appropriate
                     premium – 30% - to be applied to reflect the value of acquiring control of the company
                     through the purchased shares when the guidance on control premiums indicates that
                     the appropriate premium in any particular case depends upon a number of company-specific
                     factors.  It also emerged during Mr Skeels’ cross-examination that he had used more
                     recent Capital IQ “merger stat” data on this aspect than that exhibited to the report
                     (which was based on data from the United States).  In his testimony, Mr Skeels said:

                     his Control Premium, I have been persuaded by his evidence that a Control Premium
                     should be applied to reflect the fact that the quoted share prices of listed comparable
                     companies will reflect the purchase of a “<i>marketable minority</i>” holding.  As Mr Skeels said in his Report, the minority investor typically cannot
                     influence the strategic direction of the business and/or have access to its cash flows
                     in the same way that a controlling shareholder of a private company can. As such the
                     difference between a controlling stake and a marketable minority stake is the Control
                     Premium.

                     to be justified by specific financial benefits to be gained through the acquisition
                     of control, and he maintained his position that in this case the premium was zero,
                     the answers he gave in cross-examination put a bit of a gloss on that.  I refer to

                                 you for getting those synergies and so you would be willing to pay more. The control

                                 is financial control premium and one is strategic control premium, and we are being
                                 a little ambiguous in our language in not explicitly saying which one we're talking

                     for the application of a Control Premium to reflect the more general advantages to
                     a buyer acquiring strategic control over the direction of the business.  Although
                     Mr Skeels had applied it in reaching his EBITDA multiples for the Comparable Companies,

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When BDO LLP prepared a Report dated 25 April 2016 for the Company, headed “Valuation
                     of Minority C Shares”, they made the point that they had not been appointed as independent
                     expert valuers under the Articles and that <i>“[P]ro-rata valuations will lead to a higher valuation of minority shareholdings because,
                        in assuming that a hypothetical third party acquirer is purchasing the entirety of
                        the business it is assumed that a premium would be payable for control and liquidity</i>.” BDO explained that when looking at the EBITDA multiples of comparable quoted companies,
                     where those “<i>multiples reflect a minority position, we have adjusted our analysis to include a
                        bid premium of 30%, on the assumption that in a buy-out of the business, a purchaser
                        would pay a premium to acquire control.</i>”  Like Mr Skeels, BDO applied the premium in their analysis of their comparable companies.
                     Their approach lends further credibility to Mr Skeels’ inclusion of Control Premium.
                     By a Note dated 27 May 2016, Alix Partners commented upon that report.  They noted
                     that “<i>[C]ontrol premiums are an area of debate in the valuation community</i>” and that BDO had applied one of 30% but did not criticise the percentage adopted.

                     a range of 25% to 40% for Control Premium, indicates to me that a Control Premium
                     of 30% was a reasonable one for him to adopt.

                              in a contentious situation this approach would be attacked. Moreover, if the adjustment
                              is significant, and 25% is, it starts to suggest a lack of real comparability anyway.

                        set to which there are subjective adjustments made.</i>”  He said the adjustments could often be of a significant amount, say 25% to 40%.
                     When it was suggested to him that the IPS was an immature business with a turnover
                     of approximately £6m and could not properly be compared with any of the companies
                     listed in his Table 5.2, Mr Skeels agreed and said “<i>to become a listed company, which is what comparable companies are, you won't get
                        listed if you are as small as our company was and they would always be bigger</i>.”  He said that it was relevant to look at other companies, large and small, for
                     the purpose of establishing the market view of the sector, provided an appropriate
                     adjustment is made for the difference in size.

                     on the basis that the transactions identified by him were not in fact comparable.
                     Mr Tozzi QC challenged those relied upon by Mr Skeels both by reference to the nature

                     of Mr Skeels’ approach.  Mr Taylor did accept in cross-examination that BDO had identified
                     two transactions upon which Mr Skeels had relied but which he (Mr Taylor) did not
                     consider to be appropriate Comparable Transactions.  In including them within their
                     list, BDO had said: <i>“[W]e have sought to identify transactions in the market where the acquired company
                        is sufficiently comparable to IPS to support a valuation.”</i> Oakley had also identified one of those two as a comparable transaction in their
                     draft Report.

                     14 November 2014 which used an EBITDA of £1m for 2015.  Although he recognised that
                     the £1.1m figure that he and Mr Skeels had agreed upon was “<i>a good figure</i>” (it was the one adopted by Baker Tilly for 2014 in their Due Diligence Report dated
                     20 November 2014) he said that, if available, the CIL Report would inform the view
                     of a potential purchaser.

                     Date.  He also referred to the LIM (which was dated 7 November 2014) which, he said,
                     showed that Livingbridge had valued IPS UK at £5.7m based on an EBITDA multiple of
                     4.7x (using a forecast EBITDA of £1.2m) and 5.3x (using an EBITDA of £0.9m) which

                     in the Company by the Claimants and Mr Lindsell.  In fact, as Mr Taylor recognised
                     in cross-examination, it was the Company which purchased the shares in IPS UK (using
                     the monies provided by the Livingbridge Investors). The 35% equity stake in the Company
                     which Livingbridge acquired had “<i>minimal or nil equity value</i>”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Skeels took a fundamentally different view of the amount invested by Livingbridge
                     under the Transaction.  He said that, in addition to the cash of £4.7m and the £195,000
                     for the subscription of the C and D Shares, Livingbridge had also invested £105,000
                     in A Shares, £480,000 in B Shares and £5.2m in the form of loan stock issued by the
                     Company: an additional £5.7m.  The cash sum having been paid to the shareholders of
                     IPS UK, he described the £5.7m as the entry value of the Company.  On the basis that
                     the Claimants acquired 60% of the Company with that entry value (i.e. £3.4m) and received
                     approximately £4.6m of the cash it could therefore be said that they had received
                     £8m for their combined 85.9% shareholding in IPS UK.  This would indicate that the
                     value of IPS UK (100% of its equity) was £9.4m.  Accordingly, based on an EBITDA of
                     £1.1m, the Transaction gave an implied multiple on the range of 8.2x.  As noted above,
                     Mr Skeels was criticised by the Firm for not referring to the LIM.  He said it was
                     not relevant, having dealt with the implied value of the Transaction in his report.

                     of them in their tax returns.  Mr Taylor’s point in relation to implied multiple at
                     the First Valuation Date was that the Company had no equity value “<i>from just before to just after the Transaction</i>” because its EV comprised only Livingbridge’s loan notes, so that Livingbridge’s
                     35% shareholding had no value.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As Mr Leiper put the point to Mr Taylor in cross-examination, this reasoning does
                     appear to bring into account the post-Transaction debt in the exercise of the pre-Transaction
                     valuation of the business.  This is not just a point about the First Valuation Date
                     being immediately before the Transaction.  On Mr Taylor’s approach, the existence
                     of the Livingbridge loan notes substantially reduces the value of the business (in
                     the Company’s ownership) by reference the fact that most of the monies used to fund
                     its acquisition were borrowed on the security of the loan notes.  When the subject
                     matter of the valuation on the First Valuation Date is the shareholding in IPS UK,
                     and that is determined by reference to the EV of that company which owns the business,
                     there is in my judgment limited value in looking at the manner in which the purchaser
                     of the business proposes to structure and fund the purchase. The price of an asset
                     does not depend upon whether the buyer is flush with cash or in the red (any more
                     than it depends upon priority distribution rights as between different classes of
                     shareholder of the buyer, such as the RPP, which govern the position when the asset
                     comes to be re-sold).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">When the investment in the Company, as purchaser, takes the form not just of lending
                     but also an equity stake (the A, B, C and D Shareholdings held by Livingbridge, the
                     Claimants and Mr Lindsell) it is not unreasonable to assume that the shareholders
                     in the Company, as the willing buyer, consider it has acquired a business of some
                     value. As Mr Leiper observed, a willing buyer does not value the hope of a future
                     return from the business at nil. As the LIM, which I address below, expressed the
                     point in relation to the C and D Shares (in Section 1B: “Deal Structure”): “<i>[M]anagement are rolling </i><i><u>existing value</u></i><i> into ordinary shares</i>” (my emphasis).  Given the investment recommendation in the LIM, which noted the
                     proposed RPP, Livingbridge must surely have thought the A and B Shares also had value
                     (especially given the RPP) notwithstanding the debt owed by the Company to Livingbridge.
                     I deal below with the pre-Transaction correspondence from Livingbridge indicating
                     what (in excess of the £5.1m odd owed to it) it considered the value of the business
                     acquired from IPS UK to be.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, Mr Billingham’s approach correctly focuses upon the question of what
                     the Livingbridge offer indicated the value of the business to be in the hands of IPS
                     UK, the seller, without the distraction of a different valuation of the buyer (which
                     is put at nil because of the way the purchase was funded).  Mr Skeels correctly summarised
                     this basic point when he said the EV is “<i>the same the day before and the day after</i>” and “<i>[S]o the enterprise value, in my view, hadn't changed between the two dates; how you
                        allocate that value has</i>.” He explained further:

                              transaction happening, and effectively saying it cannot have changed value at that
                              level over -- over a two-day period. So on the day before, all of that value is attributable
                              to the vendors; the day after they effectively have received 4.6 million and there's
                              a balance of -- they own 60 per cent of the company which has whatever that debt is
                              5.5 million of debt 5.7 million of debt in it and the enterprise value is the same,
                              you take off the 5.7 of the debt and what's left is effectively the value for the
                              total equity of the business at that point in time.”</i></p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In section 4.3 of his first Report, Mr Taylor explained that the EV of a business
                     will always equal the sum of all investment interests in the business and he explained
                     that the investment interests can consist of equity, debt securities and unsecured
                     loans.  It seems to me that, by focusing upon the investment interests in the Company,
                     and essentially upon the Livingbridge debt rather than the shares which he regarded
                     as worthless because of that debt, Mr Taylor has allowed his analysis of the EV of
                     the Company (or possibly even what amounts to a net asset valuation of the Company)
                     to devalue the EV of IPS UK.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On Mr Taylor’s analysis, there is something of a self-fulfilling prophecy in his conclusion
                     that the Claimants, through the cash received of £4.6m, obtained from Livingbridge
                     full market value for their shares in IPS UK because it gives no credit (beyond par
                     value) for their shareholding in Company which has acquired what was clearly regarded
                     by all parties to the Transaction as a valuable business.  To express the point another
                     way, as Mr Leiper did, it is as if the £5.7m odd invested by Livingbridge in the Company
                     (over £5.1m of loan stock and approximately £585,000 for the A and B Shares) was made
                     notwithstanding they had already paid the Claimants full market value for the business.
                     This does indeed seem counterintuitive.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Tozzi QC questioned Mr Skeels as to why he had ignored this clear evidence in the
                     LIM that Livingbridge had calculated the multiple at 4.2x to 4.75x.  Mr Skeels said
                     he had not referred to it because “<i>I don’t think that’s the right value for the business at the first valuation date</i>.”  However, he said that his report had dealt with the implied value of the Company
                     (£5.7m) based on the Livingbridge investment amount.  His implied multiple (of 5x
                     by reference to that amount) was in essence the same thing as what he described as
                     “<i>the cash multiple of what they’ve put up for the business</i>” which was shown by the LIM.  Mr Skeels said the multiples of 4.2x to 4.75x were
                     addressing the initial upfront consideration.  By “<i>cash multiple</i>” he meant that Livingbridge were focusing upon the cash return on their investment
                     and that those particular multiples did not take account of the deferred elements
                     (or equity value of the Company) under the Transaction.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">With some trepidation, given that none of the authors of the LIM were before me to
                     explain it, I have concluded that the Firm has read too much into the quoted passage
                     which, I note, begins with the statement “<i>Due to management rolling into ordinary equity we are measuring entry pricing on a
                        money back basis</i>.”  Mr Taylor said he did not think the phrase “<i>on a money back basis</i>” was a term of art, though he did recognise that the focus appeared to be on their
                     return from their investment.  However, he maintained that it indicated the price
                     they were willing to pay under the Transaction.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Looking at Section 1B of the LIM it is clear that the entry multiples of 4.75x and
                     4.2x are derived from the £5.7m explained at the beginning of that section, according
                     to whether the EBITDA is taken to be £1.2m or £1.38m.  I would note here that, if
                     the EBITDA is taken as the £1.1m adopted by the experts for the First Valuation Date,
                     then the reverse calculation would lead to a multiple of approximately 5.2x.  Mr Taylor
                     said the LIM indicates the price Livingbridge were willing to pay for the business.
                     However, as I read it, the reverse calculation of the different multiples is based
                     upon the amount of funding Livingbridge was committing to the Transaction. The two
                     are different things, especially when (as explained in the section: “<i>Sources</i>” and “<i>Uses</i>”) £1.021m of that £5.7m was going in “<i>deal fees</i>”, leaving an “<i>EV</i>” of £4.716m.  When commenting upon Livingbridge’s formal offer of 19 May 2014, which
                     referred to the funding of transaction fees of £1m, Mr Billingham said this was “<i>incredibly high but not unusual</i>” and said the Claimants should suggest that Knight’s fees were also included.  The
                     transaction fees and costs associated with making an investment are highly relevant
                     to the return that the investor (incurring those costs in an amount specific to him)
                     but whether they should influence the price of the investment is quite another matter.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It therefore seems to me that this section of the LIM was illustrating the multiple
                     that would be required (at the different EBITDA figures) for Livingbridge to secure
                     the repayment of the principal amount of their funding (i.e. “<i>on a money back basis</i>”).  This approach seems to have been prompted by the fact that the Claimants and
                     Mr Lindsell were rolling over equity into the Company (“[<i>D]ue to management rolling into ordinary equity</i>”) and the implied EBITDA multiples seem to have been calculated from the perspective
                     of Livingbridge as funder.  Although the £5.7m does include the nominal value of its
                     shareholding in the Company as well as its loan stock, the implied multiples required
                     for Livingbridge to get its money back took no account of the RPP attached to the
                     Livingbridge shareholding; though in the same section its impact had been illustrated
                     with the observation that “<i>…. if we sold IPS the day after completion for £11.5m, all proceeds would come to
                        ISIS as all value would shift in the equity structure to ISIS until 2 x returns is
                        achieved</i>”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Therefore, following on from my observations above in relation to the EBITDA implied
                     by the Transaction, the calculation of the implied multiples in the LIM does not appear
                     to have taken account of that part of the EV of IPS UK which was carried into the
                     shareholdings in the Company.

                     and, because of the sweet equity arrangement then proposed, a 25% shareholding in
                     the Company.  This was on the basis that Livingbridge would provide £6.5m of funding
                     (including £1m for transaction fees) and one of the conditions of the offer was Livingbridge
                     being “<i>satisfied with the adjusted underlying EBITDA for the year ended 30 November 2014

                     included: “<i>I propose that we acquire a further 10% from Kevin and Paul at a cost of £1m. This

                     was in excess of the £825,000 which the current valuation of £8.25m (7.5x £1.1m) adopted
                     by Livingbridge would indicate.  He accepted in cross-examination that on 24 March

                     tax clearance letter (which adopted that analysis of the consideration) mentioned
                     below, and the Claimants’ own tax returns.

                     inferring that was the EV of IPS UK.  In order for that to follow the value of the
                     consideration shares in the Company (which has acquired the enterprise) would have
                     to the same as their nominal value of £0.01 each: a total of £205,000 across the Claimants’
                     18 million (odd) C Shares and Mr Lindsell’s 1.5 million D Shares.  Of course, Mr Taylor
                     says they were not even worth that, being valueless at issue regardless of the RPP,
                     but the point is that these documents did not put any value on the rolled over equity.

                     IPS UK by reference to the consideration received by its shareholders when that includes
                     an ongoing stake in the enterprise through shares in the Company: the rolled over
                     equity. A £0.01p C Share is not necessarily worth the same as one pence of the cash
                     consideration.  The value of the share will reflect the Company whether that is measured
                     by reference to its EV or some other basis of valuation.

                     upon the basic structure of it) and it was headed “Project Spur - Consideration (EV
                     £4.9m).”  The footnotes to the table show that EV figure equates to the “<i>headline proceeds</i>” which are the total of the “<i>implied total cash out per the offer letter</i> <i>and the rollover stake (65%) in Newco</i>”.  Again, therefore, this appears to be an exercise in reverse reasoning by which
                     the EV is assessed by reference to the consideration payable but where the actual
                     value of the rollover equity (as opposed to its face value) is not known.  In my judgment,
                     the limitations of this are obvious when the position of Mr Fawcett is considered.
                     As appears from the PwC table and the SPA, he was selling his 4% shareholding in IPS
                     UK but not also “paid” any rollover equity.  Yet, as I understand the position, he
                     acquired a 4% share of what PwC then described as the “<i>headline proceeds</i>” (and, under provisions of some complexity, 4% of the Purchase Price under the SPA).
                     If so, that shows that no separate thought was given to the value of the rollover
                     equity.

                     between the <i>acquisition cost</i> of an asset (ignoring for present purposes that there may have been further capital
                     expenditure upon it) and its disposal price.  It may be that HMRC will deem the latter
                     in certain circumstances to have been a disposal at market value, if the actual sale
                     price was lower, but it would be surprising if the taxpayer could, with a view to
                     reducing or eliminating what would otherwise be the later taxable gain, be permitted
                     to inflate the deemed acquisition cost by relying upon not what he paid for the asset
                     but what he said it was <i>worth</i> when he acquired it.  As things turned out the Claimants reported a capital loss.
                     However, if their fortunes within the Company had turned out as they had hoped back
                     in December 2014 and they had each, say, sold their shares in the Company in 2018
                     for £5m, I cannot imagine that HMRC would have accepted that they should be treated
                     as having acquired them on the earlier date at the kind of value which Mr Skeels would
                     have put upon them.

                     in effect, they paid that sum for them.  It was the par value which was reported to
                     HMRC and not some as yet unrealised price reflecting their then value (whether that
                     was the kind of value indicated by Mr Skeels or, as Mr Taylor would have it regardless

                     Further, as the Claimants pointed out, Mr Crossley was involved in this tax aspect.
                     He and his colleague Mr Crawford wrote to HMRC on 22 October 2014 seeking certain
                     tax clearances and the letter explained that there was “<i>no deferred consideration</i>” payable to the Claimants or Mr Lindsell but, unlike Mr Fawcett, they were required
                     by Livingbridge to “<i>effectively reinvest the balance of the £4,910,842 equity value payable for the [IPS
                        UK] shares (£195,000)  into [the Company]</i>” and “[<i>t]he reinvestment will be achieved by them each rolling over a proportion of their

                     there had been numerous re-forecasting events by July 2015.  Mr Skeels questioned

                     basis (the first was “Adjusted EBITDA” and the later one was “Trading EBITDA”).  He
                     said that, by taking the adjusted figure of £0.6m, Mr Taylor had allowed for adjustments

                     for the company in question the matters which are to be taken into account include

                     Allowing for the inescapable point that the operating costs of the Company were obviously
                     not the same as those of IPS UK (see, for example, Mr Taylor’s use of EBITDA figures
                     which are adjusted for all the management costs associated with the Company) it is
                     striking that Mr Taylor’s suggested EBITDA figure of £0.6m represents a reduction
                     of over 45% from the £1.1m figure used for IPS UK at the First Valuation Date.  That
                     said, Mr Skeels has increased the figure from £1.1m to £1.3m even though, as Mr Tozzi
                     put to him, the Company had in fact underperformed against the Spur 57 projections
                     and the figures which showed that had been prepared in accordance with proper accounting

                     next 2 to 3 years when considering the maintainable earnings of the business.  He
                     had support for that in the summaries of valuation methodology and the December 2015
                     forecast figures (for 2018 and 2019) contained in the BDO Report.  However, the questions
                     raised by Alix Partners upon the 2015 figures (paragraph 317 above) were not explored
                     before me in a way which might have enabled me to reach a firmer view upon whether
                     he was being unduly optimistic, Mr Taylor was being too pessimistic, or perhaps a
                     bit of both.

                     reasonable to take their (substantial) consensus over the earlier EBITDA for IPS UK
                     as providing a firm steer on the appropriate EBITDA figure for the Company on the

                              have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although the Firm submitted otherwise, in suggesting the conclusion of May J was plainly
                     wrong, I do not find the meaning of article 18.4.1 easy to discern.  At first sight,
                     its aim appears to be clear: to give the leaver a proportionate share of the equity
                     of the Company determined by fair market value reasoning with no minority discount
                     being applied.  Whether it achieves that is not so obvious.  Moreover, as I said to
                     the parties during the course of closing submissions, using the parlance of the CPR
                     on permission to appeal, this Section 9 judge is being asked by the Firm to doubt
                     the correctness of the decision of a High Court Judge.

                     that a more authoritative ruling on the point was not provided by the Court of Appeal,
                     because the appeal from May J was compromised, I have concluded that May J did misconstrue
                     article 18.4.1 in the Quantum Judgment.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In now supporting the conclusion reached by May J, and the reasoning in paragraph
                     23 of the Quantum Judgment, the Claimants say that, in reaching a value of the Leaver's
                     Shares, the valuer must assume that the entire share capital is being sold in accordance
                     with the Articles.  Article 18.4.1 does not refer to a “Share Sale” (as defined in
                     the Articles) because the hypothetical sale of all the shares necessarily includes
                     a lesser transaction involving the transfer of a shareholding sufficient to confer
                     upon the transferee a majority shareholding (a “Controlling Interest”) for the purposes
                     of meeting that definition.  The valuer must assume that there is a mutual exit as
                     between all existing shareholders (and all classes of them) and the valuer must also
                     assume that this is through a sale.  Article 13.3 is titled “Exit provisions” and
                     the Articles define an “<i>Exit</i>” as meaning a “<i>Listing or a Share Sale</i>.” This means the valuer, determining value by reference to a hypothetical sale, must
                     take account of the RPP in article 13.3; and unless and until that has been satisfied,
                     there is no value in the C Shares.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the course of his opening submissions I raised with Mr Leiper the potential implications
                     of the Quantum Judgment in that it impliedly (though not expressly) rests upon the
                     notion that the valuation process requires recognition of a Share Sale for article
                     13.3 purposes.  I suggested that the greater the scope of the Investor Direction (by
                     Livingbridge) under article 17.3, the cheaper the price for the Leaver’s shares becomes,
                     in that a direction in relation to 5% of the Claimants’ respective shareholdings (or,
                     say, Mr Lindsell’s 10%) would not trigger the “<i>Controlling Interest</i>” requirement under an article 13.3 “<i>Share Sale</i>” whereas a direction in relation to the entirety of their shareholdings would.  I
                     agreed with Mr Leiper that the scenario was (if for that reason alone) a fanciful
                     one.  However, in his closing submissions Mr Leiper highlighted the flaw in my assumption.
                     It overlooked that the hypothetical sale is one where the Leaver’s shares (whatever
                     percentage of them has been made the subject matter of the Investor Direction) are
                     being sold alongside all other shares in the company, including any held by him which
                     were not the subject of an Investor Direction.  That is his point about the hypothetical
                     sale necessarily embracing a lesser Share Sale.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Leiper QC noted the two particular features of the Leaver's Shares: (a) that they
                     are a minority shareholding, to which a discount would ordinarily be applied and (b)
                     that they are shares of a particular class (in the Claimants' case C Shares and in
                     Mr Lindsell's case D Shares).  He said that article 18.4.1 requires that the first
                     be ignored, but that the second be recognised.  In his closing submissions, he emphasised
                     that the valuer is to assume a sale “<i>in accordance with these Articles</i>”.  As I mention in Section K below, this phrase was introduced at a fairly late stage
                     of the legal drafting process.  This, he submitted, was language which specifically
                     enjoins the valuer to take account of the RPP, if applicable, at the point of valuation.
                     Those words have no meaning unless they refer to the RPP.  Taking issue with the Firm’s
                     argument that article 13.3 is dealing with an entirely separate point of how any proceeds
                     of sale are to be distributed between shareholders, rather than the valuation of the
                     entire equity held between them, Mr Leiper said it did not follow that the earlier
                     provision was irrelevant when assessing the value of the shares of the Leaver.  It
                     does not provide the valuation of the Company but it informs the valuation of those
                     shares.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Leiper’s emphasis in his closing submissions upon the reference to the hypothetical
                     sale of <u>all</u> of the shares in IPS UK “<i>in accordance with these Articles</i>” caused me to consider whether there were other provisions within the Articles, aside
                     from article 13.3, regulating such a sale.  As illustrated by Mr Leiper’s argument
                     as to why article 18.4.1 does not refer to the (potentially) smaller transaction conferring
                     a “<i>Controlling Interest</i>”, the focus of article 13.3 is upon a sale which might be less than that of the entire
                     issued share capital.  After a quick review of the Articles generally, I raised with
                     counsel the question of whether or not there might be such other provisions.  The
                     provisions of article 17 (Tag Along and Come Along) being expressly disapplied by
                     the language of article 18.4.1, I tentatively suggested that the provisions in article
                     19 might potentially be of some significance for the purposes of this notional sale
                     to a willing buyer, despite the fact that all existing shareholders are assumed to
                     be selling to a willing buyer and that, on its face at least, article 19.9  (“<i>the Seller shall not be entitled to sell any of the Sale Shares for which no buyer
                        has been found</i>” (sic)) appears to preclude rather than permit the sale of any shares otherwise than
                     to those pre-emptively entitled to take them up, even if they do not want to buy them.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On my subsequent review of the Articles, the only other provision which might be said
                     to regulate a sale of all of the shares in IPS UK is article 16.4 which states that
                     (save for transfers pursuant to the Tag Along and Come Along provisions) “<i>no Shares may be transferred unless 1. an Investor Consent has been obtained; and
                        2. save as otherwise required pursuant to the Investment Agreement, the proposed transferee
                        has entered into an agreement to be bound by the Investment Agreement in the form
                        required by that agreement</i>.”  The Investment Agreement is a complex document (containing provision for such
                     matters as the sweet equity) and, at first sight, there are provisions within it which
                     Livingbridge, as holder of loan stock separate from its shareholding, might wish to
                     secure a purchaser’s adherence to even if the purchaser is deemed to also be buying
                     the Livingbridge shareholding.  However, the parties did not address the terms of
                     the Investment Agreement at trial and I therefore proceed on the basis that there
                     are no other provisions in the Articles which obviously detract from Mr Leiper’s suggested
                     link of the relevant words back to article 13.3.

                           “<i>Share Sale</i>” used in article 13.3. The Claimants did not in fact sell their shares in IPS UK
                           but instead transferred them back to the company.  The Company’s own pleaded case
                           in the Leaver Litigation recognised there was no Share Sale.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The forced transfer would not or might not lead to the acquisition of a Controlling
                           Interest for the purposes of a qualifying Share Sale.  Encouraged, perhaps, by my
                           observation during opening submissions (see paragraph 333 above) the Firm pointed
                           to the scenario of an Investor Direction in relation to a smaller percentage of the
                           Claimants’ shares or (given that he would also be vulnerable to the RPP) on given
                           in relation to Mr Lindsell’s 5% D shareholding.  There was a unitary definition of
                           Market Value for any Leaver in Article 18.4.1 and no room for saying that, although
                           the RPP could not apply to a forced transfer of Mr Lindsell’s shares as a Leaver,
                           it does apply to a forced transfer by the Claimants.  If the analysis does not work
                           for Mr Lindsell, it does not work at all.  The Firm also referred to article 19.1
                           which provided for an Investor Direction that the Sale Shares be offered to <i>“…the Company and/or a replacement Employee; and/or an existing Employee; and/or an
                              Employee Trust…</i>”.  If the shares were offered to another employee (e.g. Mr Lindsell) then he would
                           not acquire a Controlling Interest.  It was also said that Livingbridge could not
                           acquire a Controlling Interest (as defined) because article 13.4 provided that “…<i>the votes capable of being cast by the holders of the A Ordinary Shares together shall
                              not in aggregate in any circumstances…exceed more than 49.9% of the votes capable
                              of being cast…</i>” .

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Article 13.3 is concerned with the distribution of the “<i>Proceeds of Sale</i>” following a Share Sale, as defined.  That definition requires the “<i>completion</i>” of the sale of shares.   A provision which presupposes that the consideration for
                           the shares which are the subject of the Share Sale has already been ascertained cannot
                           be used as a mechanism to determine the amount of that consideration.  The RPP works
                           sensibly in the context of a sale of shares to a third party but not in the case of
                           the determination of Market Value on a forced transfer.  In the absence of actual
                           proceeds of sale, it does not make sense to talk about the RPP applying.

                           it cannot be known whether the distribution in respect of the Leaver’s Shares would
                           be in accordance the <i>pari passu</i> regime of article 13.2 or instead subject to the RPP in article 13.3.   May J did

                     more basic point that there was no Share Sale) are vulnerable to Mr Leiper’s riposte
                     noted in paragraph 333 above, I find the Firm’s analysis of article 18.4.1 to be the

                     Claimants’ shareholdings was a hypothetical sale not an actual one.  And it was one
                     where the subject matter of the presumed sale, as at the Leaving Date, was all the

                     hypothetical nature of the sale underpinning the expert determination under article
                     18.4.1.  Just as the first matter to be disregarded required the Leaver to benefit
                     from the appropriate proportion of the total value of the Company’s equity without
                     any minority discount, so too the instruction to disregard the fact that they may
                     be subject to article 17 (under which the Claimants were deemed to have served Transfer
                     Notices) requires the actual circumstances in which they are being sold to be ignored.
                     The expert valuer is directed to assume that a sale of all the shares in the Company
                     to a willing buyer is taking place, at the earlier Leaving Date, and not just the
                     transfer of the Leaver’s shares in accordance with the pre-emption provisions of article
                     19.  The hypothetical basis of the valuation is further reinforced by the fact that
                     he is required to determine the value of the Leaver's Shares, which the Articles define
                     to mean <i>all</i> of the Shares held by a Leaver (or to which he is entitled) on the Leaving Date even
                     though the Sale Shares covered by the article 17.3 Investor Direction might be a fewer
                     number of them.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The parties to the presumed sale are “<i>a willing seller and a willing buyer</i>.”  In the Quantum Judgment the judge in effect gave the hypothetical buyer credit
                     for the fact that the Class C shares are encumbered by the RPP.  The class and quantity
                     of the shares which were the subject matter of the Claimants’ transfers (“<i>the Leaver’s Shares</i>”) meant the valuer was required to consider the position as if there had been a Share
                     Sale so far as the impact of the RPP was concerned.  To put it another way, the judge
                     was valuing the seller’s net “equity” in the subject matter shares.

                     sold for £1m should not be treated as having that value because it is mortgaged and
                     the owner will have to suffer the deduction of, say, 90% of the sale proceeds in discharge
                     of the security.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I agree with them that this cannot be the right approach when an independent valuer
                     was required to determine <i>the market value</i> of the Leaver’s Shares.  This entails looking at what they are worth on the market
                     or, if there is no market as such, what they are considered to be worth to the purchaser.
                     The seller having shown a willingness to sell, the market price of an asset is determined
                     at least as much by the appetite of the buyer (a point which clearly emerges from
                     the disputed expert valuation evidence in this case) and a buyer is not generally
                     concerned as to what the seller does with the proceeds of the sale price upon which
                     they are agreed.  A seller would receive short shrift from a buyer if he suggested
                     the market price of the asset should be higher because he, the seller, was (for reasons
                     specific to him) obliged to relinquish the whole or part of the sale proceeds to someone
                     else; and the opposite would hold true for a buyer trying to price the asset by reference
                     to the seller’s lesser interest in its proceeds of sale.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There is in my judgment certainly no basis for qualifying the market value of the
                     Leaver’s Shares when the hypothetical purchaser is also acquiring the Class A and
                     Class B shares which enjoy priority under the RPP.  The Quantum Judgment did not engage
                     with the words “<i>as if the entire issued share capital of the Company were being sold</i>.”  It is not clear to me why the hypothetical buyer of the C Shares should expect,
                     or why the hypothetical seller would be willing to give, credit for a provision whose
                     value is acquired (on the hypothetical purchase of the A and B Shares) under the very
                     same transaction.  Reverting to the house purchase analogy, rather than the conventional
                     sale of the property at its market price leaving the vendor’s solicitors to then account
                     to the mortgagee for any sums secured on the proceeds, it is as if the estate agent
                     is offering the property for sale still encumbered by the mortgage but with the purchaser
                     also acquiring the mortgagee’s interest.  The purchaser would not expect to pay less
                     than the market price of the property in those circumstances.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">These high level and abstract observations reinforce the Firm’s essential point that
                     a provision which regulates the distribution of Proceeds of Sale upon completion of
                     an actual sale cannot properly inform, let alone determine, what the amount of those
                     proceeds should be taken to be.  The approach adopted in the Quantum Judgment to my
                     mind involved an impermissible leap from a contractual provision about <i>valuation</i> for the benefit of one particular shareholder (article 18.4.1) to one directed to
                     the quite different issue of <i>distribution of value </i>amongst all (article 13.3).  The resulting conclusion that the Claimants’ shares had
                     no value begged the very question which the expert was required to determine by assessing
                     value independently of article 13.3 (or indeed article 13.2).

                        affecting realisable value imposed by Article 13.3</i>” but the notional purchaser would not be affected at all by the order of priority

                     reasoning with the RPP “debited” against the value against the Claimants’ shares,
                     it might perhaps be regarded as presumptively benefiting from the <i>pari passu</i> provisions of article 13.2.

                     he be entitled to in the determination of the market value of his D Shares as a result
                     of the fact that the Company (to the benefit of Livingbridge as the holder of a greater
                     stake of the Company’s reduced issued share capital) had already deployed the RPP
                     on the redemption of the Claimants’ shares?  However unlikely in practice, the same
                     point would apply to any of the Claimants’ C Shares which were not subject to an article
                     17.3 Investor Direction and instead retained by them.  Similarly, why should the notional
                     purchaser’s acquisition of the Claimants’ C Shares (which were in fact redeemed by
                     the Company but for present illustrative purposes are to be analysed separately from
                     the A and B Shares held by him) be on the basis that their value is obliterated by
                     the RPP when, in his sole ownership, the Company might grow in value to the point
                     where article 13.3 not only ceases to be a burden upon them but instead operates to
                     the financial advantage of their holder?  Again, even on its approach of looking at
                     the particular shares which are being valued under article 18.4.1, the Quantum Judgment
                     did not look at the position from the perspective of the willing buyer and what he
                     would be prepared to pay for shareholdings which had this potential.

                     Articles were agreed.  The evidence shows that, at the time of the Transaction, the
                     parties envisaged that the business would be grown for a period of around 3 to 5 years
                     before the shareholders realised their interests, either on a listing or through a

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the Leaver Litigation the Claimants had highlighted what they said was the commercial
                     absurdity of the conclusion in the Quantum Judgment both in argument before the judge
                     and in their successful application for permission to appeal.  They pointed out that
                     the Company’s construction produced an outcome where, in return for their 42.95% stakes
                     in IPS UK, the Claimants were each paid just under £2.3m in December 2014 and received
                     a 30% shareholding in the Company.  However, they would then receive nothing for that
                     remaining equity stake in the business.  The effect of the transfer of a Good Leaver’s
                     shares to the Company under article 19.1 and their resulting cancellation meant that
                     Livingbridge took majority control of the Company with no further investment.  As
                     the catalyst for this was in fact the Claimants’ wrongful dismissal by the Company,
                     Mr Leiper had observed that this would allow for the most unscrupulous conduct by
                     the private equity investors.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Further, the judge’s construction also meant that the Claimants were worse off than
                     if they had each been a Resignation Leaver or Other Leaver.  Under the provisions
                     of the Articles (see Section C above) they would in that eventuality have received
                     a return of a fraction of the nominal value of their respective holdings of 9 million
                     C Shares and a fraction of Market Value, according to the timing of their departure
                     from the Company.  It is clear (particularly from the Other Leaver provisions in article
                     18.3.3) that such a valuation would be less than Market Value. However, on the analysis
                     in the Quantum Judgment, the Claimants would have been better off had they resigned
                     than had they been wrongfully dismissed.  They would also be in the same position
                     whether they were Good Leavers or Bad Leavers unless the Company achieved a certain
                     value.

                     absurdity and the Company’s competing submission that it did not justify the court
                     in “reading down” the clear wording of article 18.4.1.  The judge did not address
                     it beyond saying that, in the end, she returned to the wording of that provision.
                     For my part, I find the argument - in particular the incongruity between that provision
                     and articles 18.3.3-4 - more persuasive.

                     by the phrase “<i>in accordance with these Articles</i>” as highlighted by Mr Leiper QC.  As I mentioned above, my instinctive reaction at
                     the hearing was to think this might relate to some other provision in the Articles
                     touching upon the procedure or mechanics of an authorised sale of the Company’s entire
                     shareholding when in fact there appears to be no obvious candidate. They are a puzzlement.
                     Nevertheless, for the reasons given above I do not consider that these words justify
                     the prior valuation being informed by article 13.3, any more than it should be by
                     the <i>pari passu</i> provisions of article 13.2.

                     formed a key part of her reasoning.  For the reasons explained above, I have concluded
                     that the potential impact of the RPP on a distribution should not encroach anyway
                     upon the valuation process, but I return below to this point relied upon by her when

                     been negligent.  It says the risk that the RPP would impact upon the valuation was
                     not a significant one and that a transactional lawyer cannot reasonably be expected
                     to advise upon every litigation risk.  It would say that there is too big a dose of
                     hindsight in my reasons for concluding that risk was substantial and one upon which
                     the Firm should have advised.  Each of the points identified in paragraph 371 above
                     materialised after the date of the Transaction.  Having said that, I do not think
                     it would be right to infer from my own conflicting view reached over 7 years later
                     that Mr Morris’s stated belief a Good Leaver was subject to the RPP was one which
                     it did not genuinely hold prior to the completion of the Transaction.  I note that,
                     in the Liability Judgment, May J rejected the notion that the statements of the Livingbridge
                     witnesses contained untruths.

                     as likely when viewed prospectively from the time of the Transaction.  In their submissions,
                     Mr Tozzi QC and Mr Wright talked about the risk having arisen as a result of the subsequent
                     “<i>misalignment of the stars</i>” in a way that the Firm should not be held to have anticipated as giving rise to
                     a significant risk.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The highly unlikely concatenation of events identified by the Firm were the following:</p>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">First, a situation in which Livingbridge would want to summarily dismiss the Claimants
                           when, as at the date of the Transaction, there was no reason at all why it should
                           wish to do so.  Livingbridge was relying upon the management team (especially the
                           Claimants) to run the Company’s business. Much of the debate over the Leaver Provisions
                           during the negotiation of the Transaction were about Livingbridge wishing to tie in
                           the Claimants by stipulating that they would lose rollover equity in the event that
                           they decided to resign.  In cross-examination, Mr Purves accepted there was “<i>zero chance</i>” that he or Mr Richards would be dismissed.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Secondly, the existence of grounds for Livingbridge being able to summarily dismiss
                           the Claimants.  Under the Articles, this would require the agreement of the independent
                           Chairman, Mr Lockwood. The series of events by which the Claimants came to lose the
                           confidence of Mr Lockwood could not have been reasonably foreseen.
                        </p>

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thirdly, any summary dismissal would have to be wrongful (as it is no part of the
                           Claimants’ case that the Firm failed to warn them about the consequences of them being
                           Bad Leavers).  Again, this outcome under the Liability Judgment should not have been
                           anticipated when Livingbridge would be expected to act cautiously and with the benefit
                           of legal advice.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourthly, the court would then have to accept the Company’s construction of the impact
                           of the RPP upon articles 18.4.1 when the Firm would have said (and I have found) that
                           the Quantum Judgment was wrong on this point.  The Firm highlights the view expressed
                           by the Claimants’ solicitors in the Leaver Litigation, Clyde &amp; Co, when the Company
                           raised the point.  They said the Company’s construction was “<i>wholly uncommercial</i>”, “<i>quite extreme</i>” and “<i>clearly not intended</i>”.
                        </p>
                     </div>

                  <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">v)</span><div>
                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Lastly, the valuation of the Company would need to be such that it was the RPP (as
                           opposed to the inherent equity value of the company) that meant that the Claimants
                           might receive no or only nominal value for their shares.   If the equity value of
                           the Company was nil or very low, there was no risk to the Claimants, because they
                           would receive nothing or next to nothing for their shareholdings, whether or not the
                           RPP applied.  The Claimants’ firm belief was that the Company’s equity value would
                           have risen over time, meaning that the RPP would fall away.  This meant that the risk
                           presented by the impact of the RPP was greatest soon after completion of the Transaction
                           and, the shorter the period after completion, the less likely it would be that the
                           Claimants would be dismissed. Again, the Firm says, there was no significant risk
                           to the Claimants.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Most of these were indeed commercial risks, on which it was not for the Firm to advise,
                     though the fourth was a litigation risk which would carry with it an exposure to the
                     legal costs of arguing the point of construction and which encapsulates the risk which
                     I am addressing for the purpose of deciding whether or not the firm is liable.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">These points go to the allegations in the Particulars of Claim (paragraphs 30(a) and
                     31(a)) that the Firm was in breach of duty because it “<i>failed to advise the Claimants of the risk that they could be wrongfully dismissed,
                        be classed as Good Leavers and receive no or nominal value for their shareholding
                        in the Company</i>” when a reasonably competent firm of solicitors would have “<i>sought to advise the Claimants on the basis of a worst case scenario, and in particular
                        the risks that they were exposed to in the event that the relationship with the Investors
                        broke down or the Investors sought to take advantage of them</i>.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, those allegations do rest heavily upon hindsight and it would be wrong
                     and contrary to authority to find the Firm was negligent in the advice given or not
                     given in 2014 by reference to the events which later occurred.  This is particularly
                     so when the terms of the Liability Judgment provide no real support for a conclusion
                     that Livingbridge decided to summarily dismiss the Claimants <i>because</i> it realised it had put one over on them in the drafting of article 18.4.1.  I have
                     already noted that May J rejected the idea of a “<i>bear trap</i>” having been set for them.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Firm contends that Mr Purves’ acceptance that there was no chance of the Claimants
                     being summarily dismissed was, by itself, fatal to their case on both liability and
                     causation.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, the admonition against reliance upon hindsight as the touchstone of negligence
                     is one that applies to both parties.  Mr Leiper QC responded to the Firm’s suggestion
                     that the existence of the risk to be warned against was one which depended upon a
                     “fanciful” chain of events by saying that wrongful dismissal is a reasonably common
                     occurrence.  He said that almost any party entering into a transaction has the hope
                     and expectation that it will run smoothly; all the more so in a relational contract,
                     where mutual trust is the starting point. But those are cases where, if things go
                     wrong, they can go particularly badly wrong. And that is why legal advice is necessary:
                     the situation is unthinkable for the client to contemplate, but it is the duty of
                     the lawyer to anticipate the unthinkable but predictable.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is important to emphasise that the Particulars of Claim also contain distinct allegations
                     that the Firm failed to advise the Claimants that the RPP would apply to the calculation
                     of Market Value for a Good Leaver when a reasonably competent firm of solicitors would
                     have (1) identified that the draft Articles would (alternatively could) be construed
                     as meaning that the RPP would be taken into account in determining Market Value for
                     a Good Leaver and advised them accordingly; and (2) included language within the draft
                     Articles that the RPP would not apply in the calculation of Market Value for a Good
                     Leaver.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In response to this, the Defence makes four essential points.  The first is to the
                     effect that positive advice from the Firm that the RPP would apply to the determination
                     of Market Value would have been wrong advice.  In the light of my interpretation of
                     article 18.4.1 this cannot be gainsaid.  The second is that any application of the
                     RPP to that determination was a commercial consequence of the RPP; an agreement which
                     had been reached (commercially) between the parties and presented to the Firm as the
                     basis for the transaction.  Further, Mr Crossley drew attention to it on 14 October
                     2014. The third point is that, whilst it is admitted that the Firm was obliged to
                     advise on the basis of a <i>reasonable</i> worst case scenario, it is denied that it was obliged to advise on the basis of every
                     conceivable scenario that might arise on every construction of the Articles.  The
                     fourth point is that the language of the Articles contained standard wording for private
                     equity transactions of this kind and, had the Firm proposed a carve-out of the RPP
                     from the determination of value, it would not have been accepted by Livingbridge and
                     hence not included.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That last point goes to the issue of causation and loss of a chance.  It is the second
                     and third points which are the response to the Claimant’s complaint that the Firm
                     did not advise them that the wording (standard or not) created the <i>risk</i> that the RPP could be held to impact upon the Market Value of the Claimants’ shares.

                     breach of duty in failing to identify that risk and to take steps with a view to eliminating
                     it (if Livingbridge agreed) by appropriate drafting.  I find the Firm was in breach
                     of its duty of care in that respect.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I have concluded above, the risk was a significant risk even though it actually
                           (and quickly) materialised in circumstances which neither the Claimants nor the Firm
                           anticipated before the conclusion of the Transaction.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The risk was one created by the language of article 18.4.1.  It is no answer for the
                           Firm to say, correctly, that the RPP was the result of commercial negotiation between
                           the Claimants (and Knight) and Livingbridge.  The Firm was responsible for negotiating
                           and reviewing the draft Articles to ensure that the legal provisions were fully aligned
                           with the Claimants’ understanding that the RPP applied to an “exit” involving Livingbridge
                           and to consider whether the provisions could be read as having a wider impact.  In
                           his testimony, Mr Richards likened the position to a house purchase where the buyer
                           agrees the terms of purchase with the assistance of an estate agent but the transaction
                           is then passed to his solicitors to advise upon its legal implications.  He drew much
                           the same kind of distinction when in his email to Mr Morris of 18 August 2014: “<i>Hi Paul thank you for the revised heads, as per Keith's email below we are both happy
                              with the heads, I understand Paul B has forwarded to Speechleys to sanity check but
                              the key commercial areas are all fine with us we and look forward to pushing ahead
                              and getting this deal completed in October</i> .”  The Claimants were entitled to a further sanity check when Olswang later circulated
                           draft Articles addressing the RPP.  On 10 November 2014 (after the draft Articles
                           had been amended to reflect the RPP) Ms Cockburn sent an email to Mr Crossley and
                           Mr Billingham saying: “<i>Just as a heads up - had a quick call with Paul R, he has concerns about the value
                              of his shares if he becomes a leaver as well as the timing of receiving cash if he
                              is a leaver. I made the point that this was covering old ground but suggested we discuss
                              together on the call this afternoon</i>”.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Claimants’ evidence, which I accept and which is supported by Ms Cockburn’s email
                           just quoted, is that they repeatedly raised with Mr Crossley their concern that their
                           equity in the Company should be protected: see Section I above.  I do not rely upon
                           their evidence to hold the Firm liable as if it had somehow guaranteed their shareholding
                           was free of any transactional risks aside from the Company’s commercial and financial
                           misfortune, or what Mr Richards referred to as preserving value for him “<i>whatever happened</i>”.  Mr Tozzi QC was of course correct to say that it is no part of the pleaded case
                           against the Firm that Mr Crossley gave any such wider assurance nor that he advised
                           upon the prospects of the Claimants becoming a Leaver of any classification.   However,
                           their repeated requests to focus upon the potential downsides of the Transaction,
                           so far as their continuing equity was concerned, should have prompted careful consideration
                           of the implications of the language of article 18.4.1 as it evolved during the course

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The contemporaneous documents show that the language of article 18.4.1 was not “standard
                           wording”.  The Firm did not press this contention at trial; though its closing submissions
                           did say that articles such as 13.3 and 18.4.1 were common, so that Mr Crossley was
                           not obliged to go further than ensuring a minority discount was not applied. Those
                           documents also show that the Firm engaged with Olswang over the wording.  Although
                           I have found the meaning of the phrase to be inconclusive, and Mrs Justice May placed
                           no reliance upon it, this included the agreed insertion of the words “<i>in accordance with these Articles</i>” in relation to the notional sale of the Company’s entire share capital.  This was,
                           therefore, a contractual provision which was under scrutiny by the lawyers in the
                           weeks prior to the Transaction. It was squarely within the Firm’s focus upon the impact
                           of the Leaver Provisions.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although the particular circumstances in which May J came to construe the language
                           of article 18.4.1 were ones not reasonably foreseen by the Claimants and the Firm,
                           the risk was (for so long as the RPP remained a factor) one which attached to the
                           Claimants’ shares however they might acquire Good Leaver status.  Aside from wrongful
                           dismissal, death and incapacity from employment were other grounds on which either
                           of them might have become a Good Leaver.  By their very nature these others would
                           be unexpected events.  However, the perceived unlikelihood of any of these Good Leaver
                           events arising does not mean that the legal risk, contained within a provision designed
                           to come into operation if they did, is one that is be treated as not significant.
                           The Firm could not be expected to advise upon the likelihood of any of the Good Leaver
                           grounds arising for either Mr Richards or Mr Purves but, given the focus upon the
                           contractual provision which anticipated that they might arise, it was in my judgment
                           reasonable to expect it to advise upon the risk that the provision could be construed
                           in a way which operated to their very significant financial detriment.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Market Value, as determined under article 18.4.1, was not just key to the valuation
                           of the C shareholding in the event of either Mr Richards or Mr Purves becoming a Good
                           Leaver, whether the basis for him leaving was wrongful dismissal, incapacity or death.
                           It also underpinned the valuation in the event of either of them becoming a Resignation
                           Leaver or Other Leaver.  These were all potential leaver scenarios relevant to the
                           Claimants’ requests that Mr Crossley should consider the potential worse case outcome.
                           The fact that the risk which presented itself in the Quantum Judgment caused the most
                           acute detriment for a Good Leaver does not mean it was not a risk for a Resignation
                           Leaver or Other Leaver.  I have referred in Section I above to Mr Richards’ evidence
                           about the discussion he had with Mr Crossley about the restrictive covenant arising
                           upon him leaving the Company.  That proceeded on the basis that the duration of those
                           covenants would be linked to the receipt of a substantial payment for his shares.
                           Again, this should have prompted the Firm to focus upon the definition of Market Value.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For these reasons, I conclude that the Firm fell short of the standard of care required
                     of a reasonably competent solicitor practising in the field of private equity transactions.
                     It is one thing to say that it cannot reasonably have been expected to predict a future
                     misalignment of the stars.  It would be quite another to conclude that it would be
                     imposing an unduly onerous and unwarranted duty of care upon Firm to say that it should
                     have undertaken a cross-check upon the meaning and effect of a provision on which
                     it had drafting input.

                     Article 18.4.1 and the various Leaver Provisions to which it was applicable were firmly
                     within the Firm’s sights as part of that review.   It is no answer to say that the
                     Claimants’ own commercial judgment was that the RPP would fall away as a relevant
                     factor over time (whether or not as quickly as, say, the first 2 years when they might
                     each then as an Other Leaver have obtained the Market Value) when the risk of its
                     impact upon the determination of value has not been identified in the first place.

                     of the wording of article 18.4.1 when viewed against the RPP and, having done so and
                     thereby unearthed the principal points of construction addressed in the Quantum Judgment
                     and by me above, highlighted the resulting risk and suggested that an attempt be made
                     to eliminate it.

                     of any discount for a minority holding which it had secured for the Claimants.  No
                     advice was given about the risk presented by the RPP.  This case is to be contrasted
                     with the <i>Petrocapital</i> case where the solicitor did give what the court found to be “<i>highly tenable</i>” advice about the effect of the undertakings under scrutiny in a concluded contract.

                     as impacting upon Market Value, at the same time expressing its view that the proper
                     interpretation of article 18.4.1 meant it should not do so, then, on considered reflection,
                     I would have said that view was not only tenable but correct.  However, the fact is
                     that the risk of the RPP having such impact and, crucially so far as the extent of
                     that risk was concerned, the likely view of Livingbridge on the point, were not brought
                     to the Claimants’ attention by the Firm.   A significant risk went unspotted.

                     construed against them had been highlighted. It says that the most likely non-negligent
                     advice from the Firm would have been that there was a small risk that the provision
                     might (wrongly) be construed that way, in limited and unlikely factual circumstances,
                     and the Claimants would have taken that risk.  The Livingbridge deal was the best
                     one available (and the only one which met the objectives behind Project Spur) and
                     the Claimants would have regarded the risk of being summarily dismissed as very low.

                     of the loss of any substantial chance for the purposes of the reasoning in <i>AssetCo plc v Grant Thornton</i>: the chance that Livingbridge would have agreed to revise the Articles and the prospect
                     that, at the end of the liability stage in the Leaver Litigation, the Company would
                     have been in a financial position to pay the value of the Claimants’ shareholdings

                     of the Claimants finding an alternative investor who would have offered the value
                     for the Claimants’ shareholdings as I have determined it to be at the First Valuation

                     to the RPP.  As this would have been a red line for the Claimants, the refusal of
                     Livingbridge to agree a change to article 18.4.1 would have meant the Claimants would
                     have walked away from the Transaction.

                     of Market Value, as applicable to the various leaver scenarios, then they would have
                     insisted that Livingbridge agree it be disapplied under article 18.4.1 or, instead,
                     walked away from the Transaction.

                     “<i>small risk</i>” of article 18.4.1 being construed so that the RPP impacted upon the Market Value
                     of the C Shares.  For the reasons given in support of my finding of liability, I consider
                     that for the advice to have been non-negligent it would have to have identified the
                     risk to be a significant one, carrying with it a potential impact across all Good

                     if he were to die at a time when the RPP still worked to Livingbridge’s advantage.
                     On my assessment of the evidence neither of them would have agreed to the sale of
                     their combined 85.9% shareholding in IPS UK for just under £4.6m, with the significant
                     risk of receiving nothing more, when the pre-Transaction negotiations indicated that
                     IPS UK was worth significantly more than that sum.

                     resistance of Livingbridge to a change to the Articles but, instead, those matters
                     which emerged from Livingbridge and the Company’s solicitors in the context of the
                     Leaver Litigation.  I have referred to those above in identifying the significant
                     risk which the Articles, as adopted, carried for the Claimants.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">My own, different interpretation of the Articles obviously raises the question of
                     whether that was a piece of legal posturing which, as things turned out, proved to
                     be of greater than expected effect; and whether, therefore, Livingbridge might have
                     yielded on the point if the Claimants had raised it before the Transaction completed.
                     That Livingbridge would or might well have agreed to the change, if the Firm had raised
                     the point on behalf of the Claimants, is not necessarily at odds with my finding that
                     the Articles in their adopted form did carry a significant financial risk for the
                     Claimants which in fact went unnoticed by them.

                     of the Company’s appeal against the Liability Judgment) the Company’s financial position
                     was such that the Claimants would not have recovered the value of their shareholding

                     alternative buyer to Livingbridge if they received what they regarded as proper value
                     for their shares in IPS UK.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the context of summarising Mr Billingham’s evidence, I have already explained how,
                     on 27 June 2014, Mr Richards sent an email to Mr Billingham saying that he and Mr
                     Purves would require a cash only deal with GCI, with no shares, or instead one where
                     any shares in GCI attracted a significant dividend until sold with a long stop date
                     of 24 months before GCI were obliged to buy them.      On 13 September 2014, Mr Purves
                     sent an email to Mr Richards saying that, if Livingbridge would not agree to them
                     each having a 30% shareholding, then “<i>I'm up for waiting for a trade deal and having 2 years and out</i>.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I am satisfied that the evidence given at trial about the events of 2014 proves that
                     it is more likely than not that the Claimants would have pursued an alternative deal,
                     even if that meant having to wait for the right offer. The Claimants thought time
                     was on their side in that respect, though the Firm was right to point out that in
                     an email of 18 November 2014 Mr Billingham had pointed out the “<i>need to invest in the business</i>” in weighing up the “pros” and “cons” of “<i>maintaining independence</i>”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Indeed, in urging upon me the conclusion that the Claimants would have proceeded with
                     Livingbridge, notwithstanding the known risk of the RPP applying in a leaver situation,
                     the Firm said the Claimants would not have put off a sale indefinitely.  The Firm
                     referred to an email which Mr Howitt sent to the Claimants on 7 July 2014 in which
                     he referred to some of the issues presented by the Livingbridge proposal, when they
                     wanted to “<i>take cash off the table</i>”, and said <i>“[I]f you decide to carry on as you are, you will face these same issues further down
                        the line</i>.”

                     involves an assessment of the likelihood that, looking to conclude an alternative
                     deal, they would find a purchaser at the price indicated by that valuation.

                     of Scenario 2, the slimmer the chance that the Claimants would have secured a buyer
                     at that price.  That said, it must be remembered that Mr Skeels’ £8m valuation of
                     the Claimants’ shareholding in IPS UK (£8.031m to be precise) was the midpoint valuation
                     between a low valuation of £7.540m and a high of £8.522m.

                     standard valuation methodology and that it would be for the vendors to decide whether

                     of GCI as a buyer given that this would have been its largest investment to date.

                     had valued the contingent consideration element using an option pricing model and
                     said that simply applying GCI’s EBITDA multiple of 6x to £1.2m (per Spur 57) did not
                     produce a “<i>meaningful number</i>”.  He said that contingent earnouts had an element of risk attached to them, in that
                     they were “<i>stretch goals</i>” dependent upon targets being hit, but obviously recognised that achieving the targets
                     would produce the earnout.  He had used a software system to value the deferred consideration
                     (£1m after 12 months, conditional upon EBITDA being maintained) and the earnout (and
                     shares and cash).  He valued the first at £473,000 using one pricing model and the
                     second at £674,620 using another (noting that, because these two elements of the offer
                     were linked and he had valued the second as if the first had not been paid, that produced
                     an overvaluation).  Mr Taylor accepted that GCI had based their offer on 6x EBITDA
                     rather than the range of 4.7x to 5.1x implied by his valuation of their offer.

                     used option pricing models to value earnouts and contingent consideration.  His evidence
                     was to the effect that EBITDA multiple depended upon the inputs put into the model.
                     He described the GCI offer as being <i>“£4 million up front and up to about another 7 or 8 million of contingent consideration</i>”.  Acknowledging that he had not analysed the offers of Livingbridge, GCI, Intercity

                     additional consideration which rested upon imponderables, the court is therefore faced
                     with one experienced valuer suggesting it was worth £5.1m and another suggesting it
                     was worth almost twice that.  Mr Billingham said of the GCI offer: “<i>So if the business had grown as we were forecasting, there would have been a significant
                        payment at the end as well</i>.”

                     to be implied from the Transaction, I see no reason why I should ignore his view in
                     favour of Mr Taylor’s lower figure.  As with my approach to the Company’s EBITDA at
                     the Second Valuation Date, and perhaps with even greater justification given the broader
                     brush evaluation required at this stage of the judgment, it seems sensible to assume
                     that the GCI offer had a value of somewhere between their figures of £5.1m and £9.6m.
                     On that basis, I consider the figure of £7.2m which Mr Leiper put to Mr Taylor (6x
                     £1.2m) to be more meaningful than Mr Taylor was prepared to concede.

                     on a sale to a trade buyer at the best price and following up on earlier indicative
                     offers.  That exercise would no doubt have involved him following up with the indicative
                     offerors Adept and Intercity (and Node 4), by reference to the increased<i> “run rate EBITDA</i>” he mentioned in his evidence, and also testing whether other trade buyers (and private
                     equity firms aside from Livingbridge and Maven) might by that later stage have developed
                     an appetite for IPS UK.

                     interest in IPS UK and what Mr Billingham, Livingbridge and Oakley were saying about
                     the attraction of the UC sector to trade buyers and private equity investors all feed
                     into the assessment of the percentage prospects of the Claimants doing so.

                     measured.  In my assessment of the expert evidence in Section I above, I have explained
                     why there was more to the valuation of the Transaction than the up-front cash received

                     tribunal proceedings.  As the Company agreed to pay a further £20,000 plus VAT towards
                     their costs of the tribunal proceedings (to be added to the £350,000 recovered against

                     the Firm could be liable for would be the Claimants’ exposure to the costs relating
                     to the Quantum Judgment.   For that purpose, the Firm said the Claimants’ own costs

                     be the sum of £100,000.  Moreover, that would be the cap upon such liability before

                     However, I think that submission ignores the point that the £50,000 which the Claimants
                     agreed to pay the Company almost certainly reflected the compromise of a claim by

                     adjustment, that appears to be the sum which the Claimants incurred in respect of
                     their own, unrecovered costs of the Quantum Judgment.  Adding the notional £25,000

                     it may well be that the Clyde &amp; Co invoices of 6 October 2016 and later dates also
                     covered work in relation to the employment tribunal proceedings.  The documents in
                     the trial bundle (E/349ff and E/363ff) do not reveal when in 2017 those proceedings
                     were compromised.  To the extent that the invoices do cover costs of the employment
                     tribunal dispute, I bear in mind that the Claimants made a recovery of £24,000 including

                     is reasonable for me to proceed on the basis that their total net liability for the
                     costs of the Quantum Judgment was approximately £300,000 including VAT (£326,000 less
                     £24,000).  I have derived this approximate sum from the Firm’s total of £760,963 (minus
                     the last success fee invoice of £60,000) rather than the pleaded total of £895,141
                     (or the £908,234 mentioned in the letter dated 19 November 2021 from Cardium Law).
                     So far as the legal costs are concerned, the table of invoices in the Firm’s submissions

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The pleaded total of professional costs incurred in the Leaver Litigation is quite
                     close in amount but significantly different from the amount of £889,567 identified
                     in a letter from Clyde &amp; Co dated 15 March 2022.  As I explain below, that letter
                     identified the solicitors’ calculation of their own fees by reference to an uplift
                     under a conditional fee agreement. Mr Leiper QC handed me the letter on the last day
                     of trial during his closing submissions.  This was in circumstances where Mr Richards
                     had been cross-examined about the claim to legal fees and could not say which of the
                     particular invoices identified by the Firm had been paid.  Mr Richards did tell me
                     that moneys received from the Company in the Leaver Litigation would have been paid
                     to Clyde &amp; Co and credited towards their invoices, but that there was a contingent
                     liability to the solicitors.  He believed a first instalment of £50,000 towards a
                     success fee had been paid.  He also said he understood the conditional fee agreement
                     with Clyde &amp; Co had been disclosed; and in re-examination he identified in the bundle
                     the Discounted Conditional Fee Agreement dated 28 April 2016 (“<b>the DCFA</b>”).

                     in the Leaver Litigation under the DCFA.  The letter confirmed that the Claimants
                     had paid in full all of the invoices that Clyde &amp; Co had rendered to them.  So far
                     as Clyde &amp; Co’s fees, ignoring disbursements, were concerned they had been paid £452,225
                     plus VAT (when the correct VAT exclusive figure should have been £444,783 because
                     discounted hourly rates had sometimes been overlooked) but because the Claimants had
                     achieved a “win” in the Leaver Litigation they were entitled to charge at the basic
                     rates set out in the DCFA.  The fees at those rates amount to £889,567.62.  Allowing
                     for an initial payment of £50,000 paid by the Claimants towards the balance due under
                     the DCFA in February 2018, the balance due under it was £387,342 plus VAT.

                     for the £50,000) would be revised to the lower of 20% of the Claimants’ net recovery
                     from the Firm in the present proceedings and the original sum of £464,810.  Any entitlement
                     to interest had been waived. Clyde &amp; Co concluded by saying “<i>[A]s the dispute between [the Claimants] on the one hand and Charles Russell Speechlys
                        on the other is ongoing, we have not yet issued an invoice in respect of the balance
                        payable pursuant to the DCFA</i>” and they had no objection to the letter being shown to the court.

                     the initial risk, by agreeing with a third party that the loss engendered by a known
                     risk should have a <i>greater</i> value than would otherwise be the case.  Mitigation of loss is one thing, and to
                     be reasonably expected, but amplification of it is quite another, and is not.  I note
                     that the DCFA was signed the same day as DMH Stallard had sent their without prejudice

                     for the commencement of the claims that were the subject matter of the DCFA, there
                     is no evidence in the present case that the only way in which the Claimants could
                     (with the legal representation required for the task) continue to contest the point
                     on the construction of the Articles, in an attempt to mitigate if not avoid their

                     given by the defendant had been correct)  as a useful cross-check on a causation point
                     but it should not determine its outcome.  In particular, it should not displace the

                     management of the Company, which caused the Company to dismiss them summarily, were
                     influenced at all by their understanding of the Leaver Provisions any more than, as
                     I have already explained, it supports the conclusion that the Company’s own understanding
                     of them played any part in its decision to take that step.   The counterfactual situation
                     in Scenario 1 involves the Claimants being <i>less </i>averse to the risk of termination (assuming they vindicate their Good Leaver status)
                     because the receipt of proper advice from the Firm would, on that scenario, have clarified
                     the RPP point in their favour.  And the counterfactual behind Scenario 2 involves
                     them not being employed by the Company in the first place.  These observations reinforce
                     the point that the answer to the duty nexus question must be against the Firm being
                     liable for the costs which relate to the Liability Judgment.

                     the litigation costs that relate to the Quantum Judgment.  The language of the Articles
                     which led to them being incurred was within the purview of the Firm’s duty.    They
                     would not have been incurred had the Firm not been negligent (though the involvement
                     of the third party purchaser of IPS UK requires further evaluation of the Claimant’s
                     chances of avoiding them) and there is a direct nexus between them and the Firm’s
                     duty of care.  Further, the uncertainty and ambiguity in the language of the Articles
                     meant that it was reasonable for the Claimants to incur those costs.  The scope of
                     duty question, the factual causation question, the duty nexus question and the legal
                     responsibility question are each answered in favour of the Claimants.

                     are confluent with my assessment of the Claimants’ prospects of success under Scenarios
                     1 and 2.  I have concluded that they have not lost any real or substantial chance
                     of avoiding those costs by clarifying the meaning of the Articles through agreement
                     with Livingbridge.  Even though the costs of the Quantum Judgment (though not those
                     of the Liability Judgment) would have been avoided by one, there was no real chance
                     of such an agreement.  However, in accordance with assessment of the Claimants’ chance
                     of success under Scenario 2, I assess the chance that they would have avoided the
                     Leaver Litigation with the Company, and with it this element of the costs, by concluding
                     a sale with another purchaser, at 75%.

                     be in respect of credits for any remuneration or damages for wrongful dismissal and/or
                     unfair dismissal received from the Company.  However, in my judgment there is a misconception
                     in the Firms’ approach to these further credits, particularly when regard is had to
                     the fact that the loss stems from Scenario 2.

                     that this misconception on the Firm’s part extended to one of fact as well as principle.
                     My then understanding of the outcome of the Leaver Litigation meant that that the
                     Firm was seeking to debit the Claimants twice over in respect of the same sums.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Firm says the damages should be reduced by the sum of £65,500 by reference to
                     the two Q1 bonuses received by them and which were under scrutiny in the Leaver Litigation
                     and the damages which were ordered to be paid to them in the Leaver Litigation.  It
                     further says that, even though the Claimants were not entitled to the bonuses of £32,750
                     each, they retained the benefit of them because they were offset against a later bonus
                     to which they would have become entitled had they not been wrongfully dismissed.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By her Order dated 30 November 2016, May J ordered the Company to pay the Claimants
                     damages for wrongful dismissal (in slightly different sums) which were quantified
                     “<i>taking into account payments due from the Claimants to the Defendant pursuant to the
                        Defendant's counterclaim.</i>” Accordingly, the Claimants appear to have been debited with the amount of their
                     bonuses in the calculation of the damages: £103,872 for Mr Richards and £104,714 for
                     Mr Purves.  However, the parties then cross-appealed her two judgments.  My previous
                     understanding had been that the Claimants had not received <i>both</i> the £175,000 under the settlement of those appeals <i>and</i> payment of those damages.  However, in making observations upon the draft judgment,
                     Mr Tozzi QC and Mr Wright QC drew my attention to a letter dated 13 December 2021
                     from Cardium Law which confirmed that the Claimants had recovered the damages awarded
                     by May J following the Liability Judgment, thereby indicating that the settlement
                     sum was received in addition to those damages. This was confirmed by Mr Leiper QC
                     on behalf of the Claimants.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Nevertheless, I believe the Firm’s approach remains misconceived in seeking to credit
                     the Claimants with items that are unrelated to the loss for which it is liable.  This
                     applies to the retained bonuses (which, as explained above, appear to have been taken
                     into account by May J in her damages award), the salary they received from the Company
                     during the 8 months of their employment (£133,333 each, at least pre-tax, at the rate
                     of £200,000 p.a.) and the £78,000 they received in damages for unfair dismissal. 
                     The Firm argued that all three items must be taken into account in calculating the
                     Claimants’ damages.  The Firm recognised that, against those sums, there should be
                     offset the likely salary which they would have received from an alternative buyer
                     of IPS UK and referred to the salaries of £90,000 each which were contemplated for
                     the Claimants during a two year earnout period with GCI.  On this approach, the Firm
                     reached a net credit against both Claimants of £336,000.  Again, I note that calculation
                     includes the wrongful dismissal damages in the sum of £208,586 and also (having regard
                     to the nature of the actual and notional receipts in question) that these are all
                     pre-income tax figures.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, whether the suggested pre-tax credit should be £336,000 or more like £127,500,
                     the exercise proposed by the firm appears to confuse what I might describe as the
                     “capital loss” for which the Firm is liable and “income losses” for which it is not.
                     In my analysis of the Firm’s liability in respect of legal fees in Section I above,
                     I have expressed the reasons why the Firm’s liability does not extend to the costs
                     of the Liability Judgment.  The Firm is instead liable for its negligence in relation
                     to the Articles and the impact they had upon the value the Claimants actually received
                     for their shares in IPS UK.  The nature of the claim meant that the Order of 16 April
                     2021 confined the expert evidence to the issue of share valuation at the First Valuation
                     Date and the Second Valuation Date.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my judgment, applying a credit for what the Claimants received from their employment
                     with the Company (whether paid in salary, bonus or damages for the loss of either)
                     as compared with what they might have earned with another buyer of IPS, involves an
                     impermissible encroachment upon the proper calculation of the loss for which the Firm
                     is liable.   The position might be otherwise if the Firm had been held liable for
                     the Claimants’ dismissal and the financial consequences of that.  It might then be
                     appropriate to set against the damages certain credits in respect of the (net) loss
                     of their employment benefits and/or damages in lieu of those benefits.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, particularly when their damages are instead fixed by reference to the capital
                     loss under Scenario 2 and that is determined as at the First Valuation Date, it is
                     not appropriate to go further than comparing what capital sum the Claimants received
                     from the Company with what capital sum they might have received from an alternative
                     buyer.  Comparing what the Claimants received from their employment with the Company
                     and what they might have received through employment by an alternative buyer, over
                     a certain period after the First Valuation Date, involves pure conjecture.  The expert
                     evidence was not directed to a comparison between the Claimants’ wider financial package
                     under the Transaction and an alternative package they might have obtained elsewhere;
                     and (allowing for Mr Billingham’s observation that every pound of salary would come
                     at a multiplied cost for the purposes of any earnout, fixed by reference to EBITDA,
                     under an alternative transaction) neither was the factual evidence.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Billingham’s evidence about the impact upon an EBITDA-based earnout of the Claimants
                     drawing a higher salary under the alternative transaction under Scenario 2 illustrates
                     the point as to what is and is not relevant in the calculation of the damages recoverable
                     from the Firm.  The prospect of them drawing a lower salary than that in fact paid
                     by the Company, in the interests of getting a bigger earnout payment two years later,
                     is one aspect of the task of evaluating the Claimants’ chances of finding an alternative
                     buyer at £8m.  However, in that process of evaluation, I have made no assumption that
                     the buyer would pay them a salary in a specific sum, or indeed that the buyer would
                     employ them at all. I would add that, if I had instead found the Firm liable under
                     Scenario 1, there would have been no comparison at all with the value of a hypothetical
                     alternative transaction, whether or not involving the Claimants in remunerated employment,
                     and their receipt of the salary and bonuses (and damages for the wrongful, summary
                     curtailment of their receipt) from the Company would have been a neutral factor in
                     quantifying the loss recoverable from the Firm.

                     as at the First Valuation Date is that in respect of the legal costs of the Quantum
                     Judgment.  I note again that the Firm has not been held liable for the Leaver Litigation
                     costs generally because the duty nexus question on those has been answered in its
                     favour.   If there is no “duty nexus” between the Firm’s negligence and the financial
                     consequences of the Claimants’ dismissal from employment then in my judgment it is
                     wrong, on the calculation of the damages for which the Firm is liable, to credit it
                     with the value of items arising in the employment context that have no nexus with
                     its breach of duty and the actual loss which those damages reflect.   They are <i>res inter alios acta</i> and (at the danger of overlooking the obvious point that the Claimants had to earn
                     their salary and any bonus by giving the Company their service, valued accordingly,
                     in return) they are to be analysed as collateral benefits.  They are too remote from
                     the loss which is recoverable from the Firm to be brought into account.

                     by the Company had been remitted to Clyde &amp; Co and applied by them towards payment
                     of the legal fees, as one might expect.  In paragraph 454 above I have referred to
                     the agreement between the Claimants and the Company which also had the effect of the
                     Claimants receiving £400,000 towards the costs of the Liability Judgment.  On my assessment
                     of the amount of the costs they incurred in relation to the Liability Judgment (see
                     paragraph 458 above) that would still have left them with a shortfall in their recovery
                     of those costs of around £80,000. Even if I am wrong in my general conclusion that
                     the employment related benefits are collateral to the quantification of the damages
                     payable by the Firm in respect of the litigation costs, the point about the “duty

                     the Liability Judgment but yet being able to claim credit for sums which went in payment
                     of those costs would appear to hold good at least to the extent of that £80,000.

                     share of £90,763 deferred consideration which appears to have been payable upon the
                     crystallisation of certain tax assets.  This was not explored further in the evidence
                     and in the absence of any evidence that the sums (of some part of them) were received

                     the duty to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence (section 174), and the duty
                     to avoid a situation in which he had or could have a direct or indirect actual or
                     potential conflict of interest with the Company (section 175).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Company’s Amended Defence and Counterclaim in the Leaver Litigation had pleaded
                     what it described as the “no conflict” and the “no profit” rules “<i>as codified in section 175 of the 2006 Act</i>” (though I think the latter more so by section 177 in terms of what is required to
                     avoid the director being held accountable for the profit).  Breach of that duty was
                     alleged by the Company and relied upon not only in support of its counterclaim for
                     a declaration that the Claimants were Bad Leavers but also for repayment of the bonuses
                     received and other expenses charged to the Company.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the Liability Judgment, May J found, in relation to the bonus, that the Claimants
                     had “<i>obtained, albeit unwittingly, Company funds which they were not eligible to take,
                        a state of affairs which rendered them in strict breach of their duties as directors
                        of the Company and giving rise to an obligation as directors to account</i>.”  Similarly, in relation to the expenses, “<i>in respect of which further examination demonstrated that they were not entitled,
                        [they] were technically in breach of the duty to account</i>.” The judge rejected the other allegation levelled against the Claimants: that they
                     had made threats against the interests of the Company.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, for the purposes of analysing the Firm’s pleaded case on contributory fault,
                     it is necessary to go further than recognising that “strict” or “technical” breaches
                     of duty had been established against them.  May J considered those breaches, both
                     separately and together, for the purpose of deciding whether they constituted a material
                     breach of the directors’ duties, justifying summary dismissal, or gross misconduct
                     within the meaning of their Service Agreements. She concluded they did not.  She said:

                  <section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div>
                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“<i>For the avoidance of any doubt I make it clear that in my view, even taking all matters
                              together, there was insufficient to justify summary dismissal, whether under clause
                              14 of the service agreement or at common law.”</i></p>

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The conclusion in the Liability Judgment was therefore that the Claimants were entitled
                     to a declaration that they were wrongfully dismissed from their employment.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Yet the Firm’s Defence invites me to conclude that the Claimants were at fault in
                     bringing about the termination of their employment <i>“(albeit that their summary dismissal was wrongful)”</i>.  Mr Leiper QC described this as an ambitious argument given the findings of May
                     J.  I agree.  It is tantamount to inviting me to second guess the outcome of the Liability
                     Judgment in the absence of the Company when, as I established with Mr Tozzi QC on
                     the first day of the trial, there was no question of the circumstances of the Claimants’
                     dismissal (as opposed to the finding in the Quantum Judgment) being re-litigated between
                     the present parties.  That this is not a good defence of contributory fault is revealed
                     by contemplating the difficulty I would face, if the Claimants are not to be taken
                     to be blameless in the light of the Liability Judgment, in determining how much at
                     “fault” they should be taken to be on a reading of the Liability Judgment alone. 
                     The Firm did not suggest anything other than that the reduction in damages should
                     be “<i>substantial</i>”.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">That leaves the second matter of contributory fault (the argument over the interpretation
                     of article 13.3) upon which the Firm relies.  The Firm’s alternative analysis of this
                     in terms of a failure to mitigate perhaps recognises that this could involve the concept
                     of “fault” under section 4 of the 1945 Act (see Section H above) being stretched too
                     far.  To my mind, there is an obvious question as to whether <i>the Claimants</i> could be said to have been guilty of contributory fault, through a breach of some
                     <i>duty on their part</i>, by failing properly to argue their case on construction before May J.  If Mr Leiper
                     QC will forgive me (as my view is that there is nothing in the point) the more obvious
                     analysis of the position as the Firm would have it – including analysis of the professional
                     duties arising in connection with the proceedings in her court – would be that the
                     Claimants were victims of a breach of duty of care owed to them on that occasion.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">If, therefore, the Claimants were guilty of a failure to mitigate, it would be in
                     not suing Mr Leiper, and possibly his then instructing solicitors, for his/their professional
                     negligence in not properly arguing the point of construction before May J and recovering
                     at least something towards the damages otherwise payable by the Firm (including potentially
                     all of the costs of the Quantum Judgment as I have identified those above).

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, the logic of the Firm’s argument would, if allowed, go further than that.
                     If, vis-à-vis the Firm in the present proceedings, the Claimants and their lawyers
                     in the Leaver Litigation are to be treated as one and the same for the purposes of
                     assessing contributory fault, then the Firm’s position on the true (and plain) construction
                     of article 13.3 is such that their failure to persuade May J accordingly raises the
                     question of whether the Firm should be held liable at all.  The “legal responsibility
                     question” identified in <i>Manchester BS</i> v <i>Grant Thornton</i>, at [6], might indicate that the Claimants’ contributory fault was the sole effective
                     cause of their loss.  The language of section 1 of the 1945 Act – “<i>as the result [partly] of [the defendant’s] own fault</i>” – must now be read in the light of the legal responsibility question which is directed
                     not only to matters of mitigation but also whether “<i>damages irrecoverable because it is too remote, or because there is a different effective
                        cause (including novus actus interveniens) in relation to it</i>.”

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In Section K above I have explained why the Firm’s argument does not carry it that
                     far.  The Firm’s negligence resulted in a substantial risk that the Articles could
                     be interpreted in the way favoured by May J.  The explanation for my own different
                     interpretation given in Section J above does not detract from that risk.

                     to the Claimants’ contributory fault or their failure to mitigate in relation to the
                     argument over the Articles.  I have set out the reasoning of May J in the Quantum
                     Judgment in Section E above.   In that section I have also set out the passage in
                     the transcript which the Firm relies upon for present purposes.  However, as I have
                     already said above, it is clear that May J reached the conclusion she did in the face
                     of clear and (for my part) cogent arguments by the Claimants to the contrary.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In his closing submissions to me, Mr Leiper QC pointed out that Firm’s pleaded case
                     on this point was that the Claimants had “<i>failed to argue that Article 13.3 is concerned with the distribution of "Proceeds
                        of Sale" received from a third party purchaser</i>”, though the Firm had sought to expand upon its criticisms of the argument before
                     May J in Norton Rose Fulbright’s letter dated 1 December 2021 (served in response
                     to a Notice to Admit).  The pleaded case is undermined by the transcript of the hearing
                     before May J and the terms of the Claimants’ skeleton argument before her.

                     argument “<i>was principally based on the alleged lack of commercial sense</i>” and “<i>[I]n effect the applicability of Article 13.3 was conceded by the Claimants subject
                        to its proper construction</i>.”  These points are not made out either.

                     the complaints in the letter to be unjustified.  They amount to the overall complaint
                     that the Claimants’ argument before May J was inappropriately truncated. Reading the
                     written and oral submissions, I do not share that view.  Although the Claimants now
                     say she was right, at the time they were presenting clear and powerful arguments against
                     the conclusion she reached.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I also accept Mr Leiper’s point about the context in which the Claimants were advancing
                     their argument about the inapplicability of article 13.3.  That argument has to be
                     considered in the light of the Company’s laconism in saying (in its Defence) “<i>the market value that appears to be contended for fails to take account of Article
                        13.3</i>” and (in its skeleton argument) <i>“[A] sale of the entire issued share capital as envisaged by Article 18.4.1 is effectively
                        the same as a Share Sale as referred to in Article 13.3</i>”.  Lest it be overlooked, there is also the obvious point that, although I have come
                     down on side of the Firm’s interpretation of the Articles, expressed at much greater
                     length than by the previous protagonists, the process of getting there was not entirely
                     straightforward: see Section J above.
