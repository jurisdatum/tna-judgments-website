                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This judgment follows a finding of fact hearing in public family law proceedings brought
                     by a London Local Authority in respect of LB, a boy born in November 2020. LB’s mother,
                     the first respondent, KB, has moderate to severe learning disability having suffered
                     hypoxia at birth. She is non-verbal, she lacks capacity to make decisions about engaging
                     in sexual relations or to consent to sexual intercourse, and she is fully dependent
                     on others for her care. Her pregnancy with LB was the result of her rape by GH in
                     late February or early March 2020. At that time KB was being cared for within her
                     family which comprised her mother, AB, her sister CD, and her brother EF. GH had married
                     AB in a religious ceremony in or about 2013. They had lived together until in or around
                     2017 when GH moved out into his own accommodation. Nevertheless, they stayed married
                     and he continued to visit AB at her home and to help out with cleaning, shopping and
                     ironing. GH has admitted the rape and although the details of the offence are unclear,
                     GH says that he committed the rape when at AB’s home. The anonymity of the Local Authority
                     and all individuals concerned, including GH, is preserved to protect the identity
                     of KB, who is a highly vulnerable woman, and LB, her child. The circumstances of the
                     case are such that naming GH, the Local Authority or any members of KB’s family would
                     be likely to lead to the identification of KB and LB.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">AB described GH to police as one of KB’s paid carers. KB’s pregnancy was not detected
                     until over 22 weeks gestation. Therefore, serious questions arise as to the arrangements
                     for protecting and caring for KB. The Local Authority’s position is that AB and CD
                     not only failed to protect KB but that they, and to an extent EF,  exploited her for
                     their own interests. The Local Authority’s allegations are set out in the Scott Schedule
                     at Appendix One to this judgment. The Local Authority alleges, in short, that:

                     be her main carer in her adulthood. She has two younger siblings, CD, her sister,
                     who is a healthcare professional, and EF, her brother, a teacher. They are both in
                     their 20’s, unmarried and without children. The arrangements in February 2020 were
                     that KB had a two bedroom flat (“the flat”) where she stayed overnight with CD. The
                     flat was rented in KB’s name. She would visit a Day Centre three times a week. A carer,
                     JK, would help to get her ready in the mornings. JK was a woman who had the same African
                     heritage and spoke the same African language as the family. AB would drive KB to the
                     Day Centre. After the Day Centre, KB would return to AB’s home before being taken
                     to the flat once CD had come home from work. Sometimes KB would stay overnight at
                     AB’s home. There had been longer periods, when CD was committed to a placement or
                     study away from home, when KB stayed at the family home. When not at the Day Centre
                     she would spend her weekdays with AB. At weekends she would spend time with CD. EF
                     lived at AB’s home. He was not involved in the intimate care of KB, which would be
                     done by AB, CD and/or JK.

                     with AB in part due to their joint involvement in a church which AB helped to found

                     home after a blessing at the Church and a traditional marriage in their African country

                     exceeds 8000 pages. There are other bundles including a bundle comprising documents
                     found by the police on AB’s laptop. The volume of documentation is largely accounted
                     for by the extensive police investigations including multiple interviews and interrogations
                     of numerous mobile phone devices. I heard oral evidence from Dr Clarke, Consultant
                     Obstetrician, a Senior Clinical Specialist Nurse, a Key Worker form the Day Centre,
                     a GP from KB’s GP Practice, PC Gillam who was the officer in charge of the criminal
                     investigation, Mr Canning, from the Office of the Public Guardian, JK, who was paid
                     to care for KB, the allocated social worker, and from GH, AB, CD, and EF. GH attended
                     remotely from prison throughout the hearing and screens in court were used when needed
                     to protect members of KB’s family from seeing him whilst he gave evidence. When he
                     was not giving evidence his camera was turned off. He required an interpreter. Unfortunately,
                     partly because of difficulties with interpreters and the prison link, the evidence
                     could not be concluded in the expected time and so an additional date for concluding
                     the evidence had to be found. CD therefore gave her evidence some weeks later. Written
                     submissions were then received and time had to be extended for their receipt due to
                     the commitments of certain Counsel.

                     of LB being cared for within the family would remain. AB, CD and EF have all put themselves

                     represented, GH had to give evidence remotely, via an interpreter, and from prison.
                     He did not have a legal representative at hand and it cannot have been easy for him
                     to prepare for the hearing given his incarceration and the volume of documents in
                     the case. Nevertheless, his evidence was unfocused, inconsistent with much of the
                     documentation and some of his out of court statements, and often incredible. His goal
                     when giving evidence appeared to be to spread blame for events in this case to everyone
                     except himself. I refer to some particular parts of his evidence which I reject in
                     the remainder of this judgment. GH’s main case was that he was never employed as a
                     carer or in receipt of any payments for caring for KB, that AB was a fraudster and
                     that she had set him up in relation to sexual intercourse with KB - which he told
                     the court happened during the day when AB left him alone with KB at the family home
                     -  and that the whole family had abused the benefits system for their own financial

                     she had properly employed JK and GH as carers for KB but that GH was never involved
                     in any personal care and that she had never allowed GH to spend any time alone with
                     KB. She remained mystified as to how the rape could have occurred. Her sole interest
                     had only ever been in KB’s best interests and she tried to remain positive at all
                     times so as not to distress KB. She had founded the Church in which she remained heavily
                     involved. She felt that Direct Payments should have been made to provide for 24 hour
                     care for KB. She managed the Direct Payments properly with the help of an accountant.
                     She wanted to be able to look after LB within the family. In many ways AB is an impressive
                     woman who has provided care for KB within the family for over thirty years, as well
                     as bringing up CD and EF largely alone, and who has founded and run the Church. However,
                     whilst unfailingly courteous, she was frequently evasive in her evidence. She resisted
                     scrutiny of her financial affairs and her dealings with GH and sought to justify conduct
                     which could not be justified. Just as she had tried to hide her relationship with
                     GH from authorities in the past, so she tried to conceal her dealings with him by
                     failing to answer questions put to her at the hearing.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although the Local Authority did pay for some modest legal fees for CD and EF to receive
                     advice, they were not legally represented at the hearing and had the difficult task
                     of preparing their cases in a sensitive and document-heavy case largely without legal
                     assistance. I pay tribute to the way they conducted themselves during the hearing,
                     remaining dignified and courteous throughout. They understandably shared their mother’s
                     hostility towards GH. I take into account that they too had the difficult task of
                     answering questions related to their sister’s rape. Nevertheless, EF was often evasive
                     when answering questions in cross-examination. He was reluctant to give direct answers
                     and sometimes his evidence had to be extracted from him by repeated questioning. CD
                     was more forthcoming and, I found, more open and honest during her evidence. Both
                     CD and EF tended to be very defensive of their mother, trying too much to excuse her
                     conduct. For example, AB had clearly not been open with the police and social services
                     about her relationship with GH – she had not told the police that they were married
                     and she had referred to him as KB’s uncle in discussions with a social worker – but
                     CD and EF sought to excuse this by questioning the police officers’ attitude and saying
                     that the term used by AB was an affectionate name for a senior male in a social group.
                     That may be so, but it did not explain their mother’s failure to declare that he was
                     her husband. Perhaps because CD was the last witness to give evidence and there was
                     a long break before she gave her evidence on the last date of the hearing, she was
                     more open than her mother and brother had been having had more time to reflect on
                     the evidence previously given. She admitted that the proceedings had demonstrated
                     that the family members had not known each other as well as they had assumed, that
                     there had been compromises and that they needed now to ensure that things were done
                     properly in relation to KB’s care. It appeared to me that CD accepted that AB had
                     kept information from her and EF, for example about her relationship with GH. This
                     was something to which EF had also alluded during his evidence, at least in relation
                     to GH’s treatment of his mother. Whilst CD remained overly defensive of her mother,
                     she answered questions directly, she became more open, and I found her generally to
                     be a credible witness whose evidence was mostly consistent with the documentary and
                     other evidence in the case.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Throughout the hearing I was struck by the genuine love and affection that CD and
                     EF had for their sister, KB. EF has been less involved than CD in KB’s care, but his
                     affection and willingness to support her was still strong. CD has built a career as
                     a healthcare professional and whilst forging that career she has not had as much time
                     as she would otherwise have enjoyed to be with and care for KB. However, she demonstrated
                     a deep understanding of KB and a deep bond with her. AB too is obviously a loving
                     mother but she has allowed her own sense of entitlement to lead her to dishonest and
                     self-serving practices as I set out in my evaluation of the evidence below.

                           or otherwise of his belief is a matter of evidence (often in practice determinative)

                           his belief must be reasonable; the question is whether it is genuinely held. When

                     There has been a lack of candour on the part of them and GH such that it has been
                     difficult to discern the truth of what has happened in this case. I remind myself
                     that the burden of proof lies with the party making an allegation and that the standard
                     of proof is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. Whilst, for convenience,

                     has returned a satisfactory result for any person from whom a service is secured through

                           to have been very active and AB was involved in numerous transactions every week involving

                           carers for KB. AB made monthly payments to GH and JK as evidenced by bank statements
                           from the DP account. Payslips were prepared recording the payments. I reject GH’s
                           evidence that he did not receive payments as a carer for KB. The bank statements show
                           payments being made to him. These arrangements were in place in or around February
                           2020 and had been in place for several years before then.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">I am satisfied that AB knew that GH was not permitted to work in the UK because of
                           his immigration status. They were married and had lived together as husband and wife
                           for several years. They had a joint bank account and close financial arrangements.
                           Documents showing GH’s false name, KAS, were on AB’s laptop. A bank statement at [A77]
                           from the account of “KAS” shows a receipt of £300 on 14 October 2019 from the personal
                           account that AB controlled.  There is another £300 payment from the same source a
                           month later. Payments were made to the Church account, which AB controlled, from the
                           KAS account. I find that AB knew that GH was using a false identity and had opened
                           a bank account using that false identity.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">JK would, as she told the court, pay some of the money she received from AB as recorded
                           in her payslips, back to AB. The mechanism sometimes used was for JK to make payments
                           to the Church account. This is but one example of financial transactions that give
                           rise to serious concern that AB has used the Church account inappropriately. The amounts
                           she paid back varied and there was no regular pattern of paybacks. I accept JK’s explanation
                           that AB told her that these payments back to her represented remuneration to AB for
                           the care she had provided to KB because JK was not working the number of hours represented
                           on the payslips. JK accepted that her own pay was usually £250 per month, even though
                           the payslips in her name were for over £400 per month. JK struck me as very trusting
                           and naïve and I do not believe that she thought she was doing anything wrong. To her,
                           AB was an authority figure and she did what she was told. Some of these payments back
                           to AB are shown in bank statements, corroborating JK’s account. This arrangement was
                           clearly contrary to the Direct Payments Agreement. It was, and I am satisfied that
                           AB knew that it was, a means of diverting the direct payments to benefit her, AB.
                           The Church account was porous in that payments were made to and from it via personal
                           accounts for AB and other family members. I have no doubt that the monies paid by
                           JK to the Church account were ultimately used for the benefit of AB. There are likely
                           to have been other payments by JK to AB out of her initial payments from the DP account,
                           that were made in cash or through other accounts, but I do not have a comprehensive
                           set of statements to establish the extent of the payments. I reject AB’s evidence
                           that the repayments were arranged due to JK working fewer hours than agreed. If that
                           had been the case then the monthly payment would be reduced or adjusted accordingly,
                           rather than a re-payment being demanded. Further, there would have been a credit within
                           the Direct Payments accounts with excess funds available – but there is no evidence
                           of such credits or excess funds. Her evidence conflicted with that of JK. I am sure
                           that one of the motivations AB had for diverting Direct Payments was that she was
                           providing a great deal of care to KB herself. AB may well have considered that she
                           was entitled to payment for caring for KB in excess of the benefits she received,
                           but the agreement was that the direct payments were for employed carers, not for her.
                           By ensuring that some of the money purportedly paid to JK as a carer was diverted
                           back to benefit her, AB acted dishonestly. She was, I am satisfied, aware of these
                           arrangements because she effectively directed them, and, objectively viewed, they
                           were dishonest. It follows that AB has not been honest with the court about these
                           arrangements. I am sure that she has hidden the true position from the court in order
                           to hide what she knows to have been wrongdoing.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">GH denies ever having received payments for caring for KB and so does not make any
                           allegation that he made payments back to AB from the money received from her in the
                           same way as JK. I am sure, notwithstanding his denials, that he did receive payments
                           from AB for caring for KB. There is unambiguous evidence in the bank statements provided
                           to the court of payments being made to him which correspond to the amounts recorded
                           in the payslips. The hours of work for which AB paid GH, as recorded on the payslips
                           and represented by the payments made to his account, were far in excess of the hours
                           he spent doing minor chores for the benefit of AB and KB, such as shopping, ironing,
                           and some domestic cleaning. From 2017 onwards he would visit the family home at weekends,
                           so he was not providing anything more than occasional services, if any, on weekdays.
                           All witnesses told the court that he was not involved in any personal care of KB.
                           All he did was to help with some chores. Yet he was paid through the Direct Payments
                           scheme for 60 hours’ work a month. Statements from one of GH’s bank accounts, in the
                           name of KAS, shows that he withdrew £1,270 from cash points from that account in October
                           2019 alone [A77]. He clearly conducted many dealings in cash. He told the court that
                           he did shopping for KB. There is no audit trail showing where the money came from
                           to pay for the shopping. There are payments between accounts controlled by AB and
                           accounts controlled by GH, including their joint account. I only have some statements
                           from some accounts but the clear picture is of money passing to and from GH and AB
                           on a frequent basis. It is highly likely, in my judgment, that money from the direct
                           payments, intended to pay for KB’s care, was used by AB and GH for other purposes.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">AB has consistently failed to disclose her true relationship with GH. She has said
                           in these proceedings that they were married in a religious ceremony at the church
                           at which she, and later, GH, were ministers in 2013 and there is no dispute about
                           that. However, she wrote a “to whom it may concern letter” stating that she had known
                           GP since he had attended a church service, since when “I began to know him more.”
                           In two other “to whom it may concern” letters dated 14 and 18 February 2020 she writes
                           as a pastor to confirm that GH had been in receipt of support from the Church as a
                           Charitable Organisation for his “living expenses”. Again, there is no mention that
                           they were married. She did not disclose their relationship to the Local Authority
                           when she began to use Direct Payments to pay him for caring for KB. I have noted that
                           the Direct Payments agreement required her to do so. She did not tell the police in
                           interview the true nature of their relationship, giving the impression that he was
                           a family friend and carer, not that they were married. She referred to him as “uncle”
                           to KB’s social worker in August 2020 [F429]. CD and EF sought to explain to the court
                           that “uncle” was a term of endearment to any senior male, but whilst I accept that
                           AB was not intending to suggest that GH was KB’s uncle by relation, the use of the
                           term obscured the true relationship between AB and GH which she neglected to mention.
                           I am satisfied that the reason why AB failed to disclose her true relationship with
                           GH to the social worker, to the Local Authority and to the police, is that she wanted
                           to give the false impression that he was an unrelated, paid carer. In fact, she used
                           the Direct Payments to pay money to him which she and GH then used for purposes other
                           than for providing paid care for KB. As with the arrangements in relation to paybacks
                           from JK,  AB was dishonest in her financial dealings regarding the use of Direct Payments
                           purportedly for KB’s care by GH.

                           has misled the court in order to hide her wrongdoing in that respect. Likewise, GH
                           has sought to hide his financial benefit from the misuse of the Direct Payments in
                           order to distance himself from what appears to be fraudulent activity.

                           much in charge of those arrangements and there is no evidence that she discussed them
                           with her children or involved them in the transactions. There are payments into the
                           Church account by CD and EF, which they explained to be donations to the Church. They
                           were not regular and I accept that they were genuine. There were payments out to CD
                           and EF from the Church account but they explained their purposes - for example to
                           cover expenses for a particular event - they were occasional and, again, I accept
                           them to be genuine. The evidence does not persuade me that CD or EF were parties to

                           of the hearing I was concerned that the flat was never for KB’s use but was put in
                           her name in order to provide accommodation for CD. However, I accept that KB did live
                           there, albeit she spent a lot of time at the family home, particularly when CD was
                           not around to look after her due to CD’s university or training commitments. AB, CD
                           and EF thought it natural for agreements in relation to the flat to be in KB’s name.
                           I accept that they simply did not think about whether, for example, a warranty should
                           be in KB’s name, because, as they saw it, the flat was hers and so was the washing
                           machine within it. As to the letter about EF living at the flat, purportedly written
                           by KB, I accept that this letter was never sent to anyone. It was AB who wrote the
                           letter, as she accepted. It would have misled a recipient into thinking that KB had
                           written it, but it did not in fact mislead anyone or procure any financial advantage.
                           It does however underline that AB can be casual with the truth.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">AB did not give any satisfactory explanation for why KB appeared on documents as the
                           secretary of the Church, or for why her signature should appear on certain Church
                           documents including an application to open a bank account. This is an example of AB
                           misusing KB’s name. AB told the court that the application was not submitted. There
                           is no other evidence on whether or not it was submitted. However, KB’s signature was
                           on the document and she was, apparently, secretary of the charity for a period of
                           time. AB is responsible for those matters. In my judgment it was expedient for AB
                           to use KB as the secretary. It saved time and effort. However, it was plainly wrong
                           to use KB’s name in this way.

                           under which KB was the donor and AB and CD the donees. The family had instructed a
                           solicitor to deal with this matter. The solicitor had signed section 9 of the LPA
                           form as a witness to the signature of KB (whose name appears not as a signature but
                           in capital letters both in section 9 and section 15). The certificate provider was
                           a general medical practitioner who signed on 12 July 2018 certifying that the donor
                           understood the purpose of the LPA and the scope of authority conferred under it and
                           that they had discussed the LPA with the donor. Clearly they could not have discussed
                           the LPA with KB without realising that she did not have the capacity to understand
                           its purpose and scope. Further, the solicitor should have advised the family that
                           KB did not have capacity to make the LPA. The GP has not been traced. She may have
                           believed she was signing some other form of document. It is possible that she signed
                           without reading. It has certainly not been established that her signature is a forgery.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Naturally, it is concerning that the LPA was made in these circumstances but I heard
                           evidence from Mr Canning, an Investigator at the Office of the Public Guardian, who
                           told the court that the error of making an LPA purportedly in the name of a donor
                           who lacked capacity was not uncommon. I note that, on making investigations, Mr Canning
                           received no response from the solicitor involved in making the LPA nor from the GP
                           who acted as the certificate provider (who, I should make clear, was not the GP who
                           gave evidence at Court and is no longer a GP at his practice). The making of this
                           LPA was clearly in error: it was invalid, and it has subsequently been removed from
                           the register. However, I accept that the family were given erroneous advice that an
                           LPA was the appropriate mechanism for managing KB’s property and affairs and that
                           they followed that advice in good faith.

                           (indicating that KB had slept there overnight). She would help KB to get ready, to
                           have breakfast, and then to go to the Day Centre. JK was not a master of details and
                           appeared to me to be sometimes confused about what period she was being asked about
                           (2020 or earlier), what days of the week she worked, and where she attended on KB.
                           I accept that she did sometimes provide care for KB in the mornings at the family
                           home but also that she attended on KB at the flat.

                           when he was at the family home, which from 2017 was mostly at weekends only, but he

                           stay at the family home. I am sure that she spent a lot of her time at the family

                           disclosing his relationship to her or his immigration status, it was in using the
                           funds meant to be used to provide for paid carers for KB, for other purposes. In pretending
                           that he was a paid carer AB also had to hide the truth of their relationship. In reality
                           GH did not provide care services for KB beyond what might be expected of a member
                           of her family willing to generally help out when he was around.

                           have police or work checks exposed KB to the risk of harm from GH, it was that GH’s
                           membership of the family exposed KB to the risk of harm. I shall return later to the
                           issue of whether that risk was or ought to have been known to AB, CD or EF.

                           detrimental to KB. I am sure that the way AB saw things, she was extracting what was
                           due to her from the Direct Payments. She was dishonest but she did not believe it
                           was harmful to KB. She was KB’s carer for a lot of the time and had been throughout
                           her childhood. KB appears to have been well cared for in terms of her physical health
                           and wellbeing, her relationships within the family, and her emotional wellbeing. Had
                           AB had any belief that GH might sexually abuse or rape KB there is no doubt that she
                           would have taken steps to prevent him having any access to her. AB did not have any
                           such belief. She did not doubt that GH would treat KB as a member of his family and
                           as a professed Christian of faith.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">KB cannot speak to the events in late February or early March 2020 when she was raped
                           by GH – she does not have the capacity to do so. There is no evidence that she has
                           ever alluded to the events. I have referred to GH’s accounts to the police in interview
                           and to the Crown Court through his probation report. To this court he gave a new and
                           different account. He said that AB had tricked him by leaving him alone with KB during
                           the daytime having, as he said he believed, encouraged or coached KB to take off her
                           clothes and go to him. AB had then returned after 20 minutes, earlier than expected,
                           and found KB and GH having sexual intercourse. His evidence left me entirely unclear
                           as to the motive AB would have for “tricking” him in this way. Moreover, it would
                           be a curious plan by AB given that there was no history of KB being intimate with
                           GH and, on GH’s account, AB was only gone for 20 minutes. How could she possibly have
                           known that on return she would find KB and GH having sexual intercourse even if she
                           had encouraged KB to go to GH naked? GH had not previously alleged that AB had played
                           such a role, it would be wholly contrary to AB’s protectiveness and love of KB to
                           do what GH alleged, and it is almost inconceivable that KB would be capable of following
                           such an instruction. GH’s allegations were wholly incredible and very hurtful to KB’s
                           family. By making such allegations GH showed, once more, his failure to take any responsibility
                           for his actions. I reject without hesitation any suggestion that AB played any role
                           in “setting up” a sexual encounter between KB and GH or that KB approached GH in a
                           sexualised manner. Nothing in her previous or subsequent conduct has shown any sexualised
                           behaviour or such disinhibition.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">However, I am sure that what GH told me was truthful to this limited extent – he raped
                           KB when AB was out of the house. At the time when the rape occurred GH would have
                           had no opportunity to rape KB anywhere except inside the family home. In my judgement,
                           it is most unlikely that the rape took place when someone else was in the family home.
                           GH is unlikely to have taken the risk of being discovered raping KB with someone else
                           in the house. On the evidence I have received, KB is unlikely to have been silent
                           in the circumstances which would have been foreign to her and therefore likely to
                           distress her. The layout of the house is such that it would have been unlikely, if
                           not impossible, for sexual intercourse to have taken place unnoticed by anyone else
                           who was at home at the time. Considering all these matters alongside GH’s own evidence,
                           I conclude that it is highly probable that GH raped KB in the family home when no-one
                           else was present.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Other than the admission that the rape took place when GH was alone with KB in the
                           family home, GH’s evidence about the rape lacks any credibility and I reject it. The
                           Local Authority has not alleged that AB, CD or EF, were complicit in or present at
                           the time of the rape or that they knew in the immediate aftermath what had occurred.
                           The evidence establishes that on the balance of probabilities GH raped KB when left
                           alone with her in the family home. That is his own evidence and it accords with the
                           other evidence in the case. Accordingly, I do not accept AB’s evidence that she never
                           left KB alone with GH. She has maintained that stance throughout these proceedings:
                           it is what she told the authorities and it was what she has told CD and EF. However,
                           I find it not to be credible. AB had no reason to protect KB from GH in that way and
                           it would been natural for her sometimes to go out from the house to run errands or
                           to do some work associated with her Church. She was a very busy woman and could not
                           take KB everywhere with her. Leaving KB with another family member would be an entirely
                           natural thing for her to do. At the relevant time, AB regarded GH as a member of the
                           family. I conclude that AB has misled the court, her children, and others about leaving
                           KB alone with GH because she wants to avoid being accused of being negligent in relation
                           to her daughter’s care. She is afraid of being accused of allowing GH to rape KB by
                           leaving them alone together and so she has denied ever having done so. I find that
                           she did leave them alone, that it was natural to do so, and that she had no reason
                           not to do so. There is no evidence that GH had acted inappropriately with KB previously,
                           no evidence that he had been guilty of sexual assault or other sexually inappropriate
                           behaviour with others previously, and he had spent a great deal of time with KB at
                           the family home over several years without giving cause of concern that she needed
                           protecting from him.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">GH mentioned male lodgers as potential perpetrators to the police. In the light of
                           his admission they can be discounted as perpetrators but, in any event, GH’s evidence
                           about lodgers was inconsistent with other evidence and I do not accept it. He appeared
                           to allege that there were lodgers in the family home in February or March 2020, at
                           the time of the rape, but there is no evidence to corroborate that allegation. I accept
                           the family’s evidence that two men had stayed at the family home for a short period
                           some months earlier.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The arrangements for the care of KB changed when the Coronavirus pandemic began and
                           lockdown restrictions were introduced. The Day Centre closed and KB lived with AB
                           in the family home full time. JK stopped visiting; CD lived in the flat, EF was busy
                           with his studies and going to the gym, and AB assumed all the care responsibilities
                           for KB. Such were KB’s disabilities that she would need assistance with personal care
                           including at the time of her periods. The rape must have taken place in late February
                           or very early March 2020 given the subsequent dating of the pregnancy. AB consulted
                           KB’s GP about missed periods for the first time by an e-consult (online form) on 30
                           July 2020. By then KB must have missed at least four and possibly five periods. AB
                           wrote on the form completed on 30 July 2020, that the first day of KB’s last menstrual
                           period had been on 22 May 2020. This cannot have been correct.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On the same day, Thursday 30 July, a telephone consultation took place. AB told the
                           GP that there had been “several months” of amenorrhoea, and that KB “used to have
                           slightly irregular periods, but was every month before this … not sexually active
                           and never has been but noticed breasts are swollen and stomach is swollen.” I take
                           this to be reliable evidence that KB’s periods had been regular for some time prior
                           to March 2020. The GP’s advice was to do a pregnancy test and to call back if positive.
                           The test was done, and repeated, and both were positive but AB did not call the GP
                           back. Instead she, and CD and EF (who knew of the positive test on 30 July but were
                           not party to the advice given to AB by the GP) waited until the arranged appointment
                           on Monday 3 August. At that appointment it was recorded “AB seemed initially cheerful
                           in the consultation – stated she would have to look after the baby and that she was
                           glad KB was not suffering from any sickness … [she] seemed to be expecting KB to continue
                           the pregnancy.” The GP pointed out that as KB was unable to consent to sexual intercourse
                           “we would be concerned about rape” which “seems to have come as a shock to AB.” In
                           relation to KB’s periods, it is recorded by the GP that “she knows sometimes periods
                           can be irregular and that is why she did not think about it much more since then and
                           only after noticing the stomach swelling and breast swelling she thought something
                           is not right.”

                           not be surprised at all that AB did not know KB was pregnant as it was the last thing
                           she would have imagined. No-one ever expected KB to be pregnant and that lack of expectation
                           will have affected their views as to why she had missed her periods and put on weight.
                           The senior GP at the practice also gave evidence saying that he believed it would
                           be “possible to miss [that KB was pregnant] at this stage in the pregnancy.” He thought
                           that given KB’s normal weight it would be possible even at 24 weeks pregnancy not
                           to notice that KB was pregnant from her physical appearance.

                           There is no record of any contact with the GP surgery in May 2020 but there were unrelated
                           e-consultations made by AB in June and early July 2020 with no mention of concerns
                           about missed periods. I find that AB did not, as she says she recalls, contact the
                           GP surgery about KB’s missed periods in May 2020. She may have thought about doing
                           so but she did not actually make contact.

                           was strikingly complacent. She did not seem alarmed or concerned for KB but, rather,
                           appeared to be happy or at least remarkably resigned to the fact that she was going
                           to have a baby. The Local Authority contends that AB’s attitude indicates that she
                           had known about, and become reconciled to, the pregnancy for some time before alerting
                           healthcare professionals. AB’s response to questioning about this during the hearing,
                           supported by CD and EF, was that she had spent much of KB’s life being determinedly
                           positive so as to avoid distress to KB. Also, her Christian faith and general personality
                           gave her strength to present a cheerful demeanour even in difficult circumstances.
                           She would put on a “mask” to present to the world. There may also have been an element
                           of denial and an inability to confront the implications of the pregnancy including
                           that KB had been raped.

                           date. However, in large part due to investigations by CD, ultimately the Local Authority
                           has accepted that it cannot rely on that evidence to prove that AB or CD knew of or
                           suspected the pregnancy prior to the end of July 2020. It does maintain that allegation

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By the end of May 2020 AB will have known that KB had missed her periods for three
                           months having recently had regular periods. KB may have had some irregularity in her
                           menstrual cycle previously but AB told KB’s GP in August 2020 that more recently KB’s
                           periods had been regular up to the point where she stopped having them. I accept AB’s
                           evidence that it did not cross her mind that KB had missed her periods because she
                           was pregnant. She had no basis for believing that KB had engaged in sexual intercourse.
                           I have found that GH raped KB when AB was absent and that AB was not aware of what
                           had happened at the time or in the aftermath. It was unthinkable to her that KB might
                           be pregnant. I accept her evidence that she initially thought that KB had just missed
                           her periods because from time to time that can happen and because KB’s periods had
                           been irregular in the past. Nevertheless, by the end of May it was evident that KB
                           had a health issue having not had a period for three months. Furthermore, on the basis
                           of AB’s oral evidence, it appears that by the end of June 2020 she noticed that KB
                           was putting on weight. I accept AB’s evidence that she ultimately thought that KB
                           might have fibroids rather than that she might be pregnant, but AB was able to contact
                           the GP’s surgery, including using their on-line referral system, and she should have
                           done so by the end of June 2020 given the several missed periods and unexplained weight
                           gain. I emphasise that I accept that it did not cross AB’s mind that KB might be pregnant
                           until very close to or at the time when the pregnancy was confirmed. CD told me, and
                           I accept, that AB did not discuss the missed period with her. She did discuss KB’s
                           weight gain which AB thought might be due to fibroids and CD thought might be due
                           to a bowel problem. I do not criticise CD for failing to ensure medical advice or
                           attention was secured for KB before the end of July 2020.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">At no stage after it was discovered that KB was pregnant, did AB, CD or EF raise the
                           possibility of termination of the pregnancy. There was no urgency by them upon conducting
                           the positive pregnancy tests at home on 30 July to alert the GP. They waited until
                           the appointment on 3 August to inform the GP of the positive tests. However, the contemporaneous
                           medical records show that following the appointment on 3 August 2020, neither was
                           there any urgency on the part of healthcare professionals to address the issue of
                           termination. KB was taken to the Maternity Assessment Unit on 3 August and a scan
                           confirmed the pregnancy which was dated at 22 weeks and 3 days. The first appointment
                           with an obstetrician appears to have been with Dr Clarke on 27 August 2020 when KB
                           was 25 weeks pregnant. Dr Clarke says that she “confirmed with AB that termination
                           of pregnancy was not something that she or the family were considering and AB explained
                           that she would prefer KB to be delivered by elective caesarean section rather than
                           have a trial of labour.” Dr Clarke’s next involvement was on 27 September 2020 when
                           KB was at over 29 weeks of pregnancy and Dr Clarke’s view was that a caesarean section
                           would be in KB’s best interests and proposed to carry out a sterilisation procedure
                           at the time of the elective caesarean section. Applications were made to the Court
                           of Protection in relation to best interest decisions regarding the management of the
                           pregnancy, delivery and sterilisation (not ultimately pursued) on 30 October 2020.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Given the importance of the 24<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy to the conditions for performing a termination under the Abortion
                           Act 1967, the correct presumption that KB could not consent to intercourse and so
                           had become pregnant after rape, and the impact of continuing the pregnancy for KB,
                           the absence of urgent discussion about termination with the family by healthcare professionals
                           following the scan on 3 August 2020, at 22 weeks 3 days, is troubling. AB’s noted
                           reaction can be explained by denial, desire to protect KB from distress, her faith,
                           naivety, or a number of other psychological factors at play, but it was incumbent
                           on healthcare professionals to note the urgency of the decision whether to terminate
                           the pregnancy, to discuss that with AB and the family, and to consider whether an
                           application to court was necessary. I note, as submitted by Ms Keehan in her helpful
                           written submissions, that it is not at all certain that had a best interests decision
                           been made in early August 2020, that it would have resulted in termination of the
                           pregnancy. However, this was clearly something that should have been discussed with
                           the family whatever indications they have about their initial views.

                           termination in the immediate aftermath of the discovery of the pregnancy. Having heard
                           them give evidence, I am satisfied that none of them held religious or moral views
                           against abortion in any circumstances. Had termination been addressed with them between
                           3 August 2020 and the 24<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy, they would have seriously considered what was in KB’s best interests,
                           whether or not that consideration would have resulted in a decision to terminate.

                           were alone in the family home. There is no evidence that he raped her on any previous
                           or subsequent occasion. I dismiss any suggestion that AB was complicit in encouraging
                           or facilitating the rape, or that she knew it had happened. For the avoidance of doubt,
                           neither CD nor EF knew about the rape or did anything to allow it to happen.

                           the Direct Payments made by the Local Authority for caring provision by causing direct
                           payments intended for the employment of  paid carers for KB, to be diverted to the
                           financial benefit of herself and her husband, GH, in breach of the terms and conditions
                           of the payments, to assist in the care of KB, evidencing a lack of transparency and
                           dishonesty. By misusing direct payments in this way, AB prevented KB from having more
                           paid care and assistance which would have been of benefit to her. AB thereby placed
                           her own financial needs above the care needs of her daughter.

                        <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">AB did not follow guidelines from the Local Authority to seek police checks or work
                           checks when employing a carer. However, GH was not truly employed as a carer for KB
                           but was named as a paid carer in order to divert direct payments to the benefit of
                           AB and GH. It is not proven that had police or other checks being performed by AB
                           that GH would not have had unfettered access to and availability/opportunity to abuse
                           KB, because GH was a member of the family and would have had such access in that capacity.
                           Therefore there is no link between the dishonest misuse of the direct payments and
                           the rape or any failure to protect KB from being raped by GH. I do not consider that
                           AB was negligent or at fault for leaving KB alone with GH on the occasion of the rape,
                           as I have found she did. I criticise her for failing to admit that she left them alone,
                           but not for leaving them alone. There was nothing in GH’s history or his previous
                           dealings with KB to give rise to a foreseeable risk that he would act as he did.

                           KB. In closing submissions the Local Authority accepted that there is limited evidence
                           to make out this allegation against EF or GH. In my judgment it ought to have made
                           a similar concession in relation to CD. As for AB, firstly I have found that she did
                           not know of the pregnancy before 30 July 2020 (neither did CD or EF). Secondly, although
                           the family delayed from 30 July 2020 to 3 August 2020 in informing the GP or the positive
                           pregnancy test, I am satisfied that they did so when in shock and mindful of an appointment
                           having been made. In any event, only AB had been party to the advice to contact the
                           GP if the test was positive. The delay of four days did not materially affect the
                           decision to continue the pregnancy. I am not satisfied that the evidence proves that
                           AB or CD took any steps to prevent or delay medical professionals knowing about the
                           pregnancy once they knew about it nor that they avoided, prevented or delayed discussions
                           about termination. Indeed in my judgment, the greater responsibility for the failure
                           expeditiously to consider termination lies with the healthcare professionals. Further,
                           no financial or other motive for concealing the pregnancy or continuing it has been
                           satisfactorily established.

                           her,  which he would not otherwise have had as AB’s husband. GH’s rape of KB was opportunistic.
                           It occurred when they were alone in AB’s home. There is no evidence that he has raped
                           her on any other occasion. AB, CD and EF are not responsible for GH having raped KB
                           by intentionally or negligently permitting him or allowing him the opportunity to
                           do so. They had no grounds to believe that leaving KB alone with GH would expose her
                           to the risk of being sexually assaulted by him. AB ought to have sought medical attention
                           for KB by late June 2020 and had she done so the pregnancy is likely to have been
                           detected about one month earlier than was in fact the case. However, AB did not know
                           and it is not proved that she ought to have known that KB was showing signs of pregnancy.
                           What might have been obvious signs of pregnancy in a sexually active woman, were not
                           obvious signs of pregnancy in a woman whom it was reasonably assumed had never had
                           sexual intercourse. KB and LB were put at risk of pre-birth complications and the
                           risk of harm during delivery, and LB is at risk of future significant  emotional harm
                           when he learns of the circumstances of his conception. However, those risks were not
                           the foreseeable consequences of any deliberate or negligent acts or omissions by AB,
                           CD or EF.

                  <p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Although not alleged I have heard sufficient evidence to persuade me that on the balance
                     of probabilities after the pregnancy was identified, AB knew or ought to have known
                     that GH was a possible perpetrator and that by evasion and lack of positive co-operation
                     she failed to share relevant information with the police that could have led to the
                     earlier identification of GH as the prime suspect. AB did not tell the police what
                     her true relationship with GH was, that GH spent time with KB and, as I have found,
                     that she would sometimes leave him alone with KB. I am sure that she hid these facts
                     because she was afraid that the truth would be shameful to her and the family and
                     might expose her dishonest financial dealings. Although AB, CD and EF have chosen
                     not to be forthcoming, it is difficult to be sure what AB told CD and EF about leaving
                     KB alone with GH, but on balance I accept their evidence that she inaccurately told
                     them that she had not left GH and KB alone.

                     to agree directions for consideration of the welfare decisions that now have to be
                     made in respect of the future arrangements for LB. To date the family has not made
                     detailed proposals for those arrangements. I hope that they will have learned through
                     the finding of fact process that broad generalisations will not be sufficient. Evasiveness
                     will not help their cause. If, for example, CD continues to put herself forward as
                     a permanent carer for LB then she will need to engage fully with the Local Authority
                     to work out what the detailed arrangements would be. By offering herself as a Special
                     Guardian for LB she would be taking on a very significant commitment which requires
                     very careful prior consideration.

                                    <p>AB has dishonestly misused the system of direct payments which were intended exclusively
                                       for the benefit of KB but which AB misused to divert monies to herself and GH for
                                       their financial benefit. However, such dishonest misuse did not afford GH access to
                                       KB, which he used to rape her,  which he would not otherwise have had as AB’s husband.

                                    <p>GH’s rape of KB was opportunistic. It occurred when they were alone in AB’s home.
                                       There is no evidence that he has raped her on any other occasion. AB, CD and EF are
                                       not responsible for GH having raped KB by intentionally or negligently permitting
                                       him or allowing him the opportunity to do so. They had no grounds to believe that
                                       leaving KB alone with GH would expose her to the risk of being sexually assaulted
                                       by him.

                                    <p>AB ought to have sought medical attention for KB by late June 2020 and had she done
                                       so the pregnancy is likely to have been detected about one month earlier than was
                                       in fact the case. However, AB did not know and it is not proved that she ought to
                                       have known that KB was showing signs of pregnancy. 
                                    </p>
                                    <p>KB and LB were put at risk of pre-birth complications and the risk of harm during
                                       delivery, and LB is at risk of future significant  emotional harm when he learns of
                                       the circumstances of his conception. However, those risks were not the foreseeable
                                       consequences of any deliberate or negligent acts or omissions by AB, CD or EF.
