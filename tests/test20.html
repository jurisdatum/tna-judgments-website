Mr Younas did this in his spare time away from his main job as a Vice President of the Institutional Equities Division of Morgan Stanley. Initially, he operated Muzmatch as a sole trader but, at the end of 2014, he left Morgan Stanley and, on 7 January 2015, founded the First Defendant (Muzmatch Limited) to take over the Muzmatch business.

The claim concerned Muzmatch’s use of the word “match” as part of its name and also its use of the words “match” and “tinder” as part of a search engine optimisation (“SEO”) strategy designed to increase the number of customers visiting the Muzmatch website. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_8"><span class="judgment-body__number">8.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">By an Order dated 18 June 2021, Muzmatch submitted to judgment in respect of the uses it had made of the word “tinder” and it gave undertakings not to use that word in relation to dating services and websites and mobile applications for internet dating and matchmaking. However, it continued to deny liability with regard to the claims relating to its use of the word “match”. It does not seek to invalidate the Match Marks but argues that its activities do not infringe. In particular, it argues that the word “match” used by itself is not distinctive and that Match is wrongly seeking to monopolise a word (“match”), which is an ordinary descriptive word when used in relation to dating and introduction services.</p></div></section><section><p><b><u>The witnesses</u></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_9"><span class="judgment-body__number">9.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Match relied on the evidence of Alexandre Lubot and of Jérôme Riviere. Mr Lubot joined the Match group in 2011 and is the CEO of EMEA and APAC division of Match Group Inc. of which the present Claimants are indirectly subsidiaries. His evidence concerned the nature of Match’s business and its brand positioning. He also dealt with Muzmatch’s business and its SEO strategies and with certain negotiations between Match and Muzmatch. Mr Riviere is the Brand and Consumer Vice President of the Second Claimant, having joined the Match group in 2012. His evidence dealt with how Match had used and built its brand, with its reputation and with its customers, including its Muslim customers.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_10"><span class="judgment-body__number">10.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Both Mr Lubot and Mr Riviere were cross examined and, in closing, Ms Bowhill commented that they had “<i>stuck to the party line that their brand was ‘match’</i>”. If this was a criticism of them, then I do not accept it. In my judgment, their evidence reflected their genuine belief regarding Match’s brand and I find that they were both straightforward and honest witnesses doing their best to assist the court.  </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_11"><span class="judgment-body__number">11.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">There were occasions when the evidence of Mr Lubot and Mr Riviere related to events occurring or to reports produced before they joined Match.

Mr Younas gave extensive evidence regarding his foundation of Muzmatch and of its activities and also, supported by Mr Craig, about how the name “Muzmatch” came to be chosen in 2011. Mr Craig was another senior employee of Morgan Stanley and, save for his involvement in the choice of the Muzmatch name, has no interest or role in the Muzmatch business. Both Mr Younas and Mr Craig were cross examined and, in closing, Mr Austen (whilst not agreeing with aspects of their evidence) did not criticise them as witnesses. He was right not to do so.

As Mr Riviere’s evidence made clear, its services are principally aimed at people who are looking to find another person with whom they can build a long term relationship (including marriage). This was also apparent from research done for Match by the Isurus Agency in 2011 as well as from the more recent 2018 International Wave research. In this regard, Match differs from other service providers such as Plenty of Fish or, more recently, Tinder, which are more focussed on people who are seeking more casual relationships.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_15"><span class="judgment-body__number">15.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Because the aim is to connect people who do not know each other, users of dating services have to provide sensitive personal information about themselves and about what they are looking for in a partner.

On 1 April 1996, an application was filed to register “match.com” as a trade mark in the UK but Match did not, in fact, launch its website in the UK until 2001. I have been shown a copy of a page from that website from 2001. At the top of this page is the logo shown below, featuring a beating heart image, the “Match” name in large, bold, lower case text, and the characters “.com” printed vertically in much smaller lower case text.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><img src="https://judgment-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ewhc/ipec/2022/941/image4.png" style="width:140.25pt;height:43.5pt"></p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Below this logo, the website page has four circles labelled “My Home”, “Search”, “Match” and “Subscribe” which describe the nature of the on-line dating process.

In March 2011, a further twitter handle was created at https://twitter.com/matchUK. In each of these addresses, the word “match” was used without the “.com” element. Consistently with this, I have seen a Facebook page for Match with a logo (shown below) which also omitted the “.com” element: </p></div></section><section><p><img src="https://judgment-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ewhc/ipec/2022/941/image6.change1.png" style="width:76.61pt;height:97.87pt"></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_20"><span class="judgment-body__number">20.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In 2010, Match started providing an alternative service in the UK, known as Match Affinity. Mr Austen asserted that this was, in effect, a sub-brand of Match although, as Ms Bowhill stated in closing, that was not part of Match’s pleaded case. However, I note, that Match Affinity used a logo similar to that depicted at paragraph 18 above but with the word “affinity” inserted between the word “match” and the word “.com” in a different colour, as shown below:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><img src="https://judgment-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ewhc/ipec/2022/941/image7.change1.png" style="width:191.25pt;height:42pt"></p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_21"><span class="judgment-body__number">21.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In July 2011, Match launched an app allowing customers to download software for internet-based dating to a mobile phone or device.

Further, Match’s passing off claim as pleaded does not rely on any alleged misrepresentation made by Muzmatch with regard to these logos per se. However, what this history does show is that, throughout Match’s trading in the UK (including before April or May 2011 when Muzmatch started trading), the branding of Match’s services has generally involved some level of emphasis on the “match” element of the Match Marks. This emphasis has been by way of placement, size, colour, or emboldening of the word “match” or by its being the sole word used to identify Match as the source of the services. </p></div></section><section><p><b><u>Match’s reputation and goodwill</u></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_24"><span class="judgment-body__number">24.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In considering the evidence in relation to Match’s reputation and goodwill, I will concentrate on the material relating to the period up to April or May 2011 as that was the date when, according to Match, Muzmatch’s infringing activities commenced. </p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><b><i>The brand awareness and tracking reports</i></b></p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_25"><span class="judgment-body__number">25.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Shortly before Meetic SAS acquired Match’s European operations in 2009, it commissioned a company called TNS to carry out a Brand Monitoring Survey in relation to the Match brand in the UK.

On this basis, TNS concluded that “<i>Match is, by far, leading the market in terms of awareness</i>…” and it paid tribute (at p.38) to the effectiveness of “<i>Match’s campaigns</i>”, noting that the campaign media recalled by customers was “<i>overwhelmingly TV”.</i></p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_29"><span class="judgment-body__number">29.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In contrast to the 2009 report, in the commentary to its 2010 report, TNS generally referred to “Match” as the name of the business.

Then, at pp.10-12, the 2010 report stated that its “Main Findings” were: “<i>Awareness: Match is the clear leader</i>”; “<i>Match has a large leadership in terms of awareness</i>…”; “<i>Match has one of the market’s strongest image</i>…”; “<i>Match users’ satisfaction is only at an average level</i>”; and “<i>Match is the brand with the strongest growth potential</i>”. Similarly, in its “Recommendations” (p.13), the 2010 report noted that: “<i>Match now has the market’s strongest level of awareness and needs to nourish this brand with content</i>”, and that “<i>As market leader, Match will be the first brand to benefit from this market growth</i>”. Whilst the report makes some use of the name “match.com”, this was confined to the various tables and to the footer of the title pages for the report’s sections, where it used the match.com logo (as shown in paragraph 18 above).</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_30"><span class="judgment-body__number">30.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">This tendency in some people to refer to the business as “Match” (as opposed to “match.com”) is also apparent from the fact that the customer awareness figures mentioned above were stated to be in relation to “<i>Match.com/Match”</i>.

He referred to its investment in TV advertising, outdoor posters, radio advertisements, inserts for print magazines, PR, social media and digital advertising. Insofar as he referred to events or matters from the time before he joined Match in April 2012, he asserted (and I accept) that what he says is consistent with his knowledge of the Match business and its documents and, given the evidential constraints inherent in this being a 2 day IPEC trial, I can see no reason to doubt the accuracy of his evidence in this regard.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_37"><span class="judgment-body__number">37.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Riviere’s evidence, which I accept, was that in 2010, spending on TV advertising for Match in the UK was an estimated £4,936,000 (28% of the total spend in the whole dating category and not including the further £4,779,000 spent on Match Affinity). In 2011, the TV advertising spend for Match.com alone was £6,759,000 (31%) (again, not including the £2,844,000 spent in respect of Match Affinity). In 2012 it was £8,551,000 (52%). The sums, whilst estimates, suggest that Match funded extensive advertising and I do not accept Ms Bowhill’s comment that such evidence was meaningless. Indeed, as mentioned above, the TNS reports from 2010 and 2011 both paid tribute to the success of Match’s advertising, and in particular to its TV advertising, in creating awareness of the Match brand. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_38"><span class="judgment-body__number">38.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Riviere listed 58 different television advertisements run by Match between 2009 and 2020, including 10 that were aired before the launch of Muzmatch in April or May 2011. These advertisements would have had multiple views as they were aired on 240 or so digital and analogue television channels (including many that were accessible in the UK). They were also uploaded onto Match’s YouTube channel. I have been provided with copies of 26 of these advertisements. In 9 of them (including one called “Laces” from 2010 and others from 2012 to 2014) the voiceover (including those of purported customers) refers to “Match” as the source of the relevant dating services.<sup>5</sup> The advertisements also used on-screen text to direct viewers to the “match.com” or “matchaffinity.com” websites for more details. Ms Bowhill commented that there was no evidence from those whose voices were used in the advertisements nor as to the circumstances in which these words came to be used. However, I see no reason to doubt that the words were those of actual users and, even if this were not the case, these advertisements still show how Match was choosing to project its brand to the public (as “Match” as well as “match.com”). Nor do I accept Ms Bowhill’s criticism that this is akin to survey/witness evidence for which no permission was given. None of this material was produced for the purposes of litigation. Instead, it was produced precisely in order to promote Match’s brand to the public and, accordingly, seems to me to be of significance.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_39"><span class="judgment-body__number">39.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Match also promoted its business via social media.

I do not have figures for Match’s followers on Twitter as at 2011 (although Mr Riviere’s evidence is that they had 103,000 and 14,000 followers respectively as at October 2021). However, Match’s YouTube channel which was created in December 2009 had had over 500,000 views as at 30 January 2012 (and over 6 million views by October 2021) whilst Match’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/matchuk/ created in March 2010 had had over 6,000 page likes as at November 2011 (and 203,000 by October 2021). I note that the internet addresses for these forms of social media used the word “match” or “matchuk” or UKmatch” rather than “match.com”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_40"><span class="judgment-body__number">40.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, as set out in Match’s Amended Particulars of Claim, there were a significant number of advertisements in printed and online media which used the Match Marks.

Mr Younas’ evidence was (and I accept) that he was a practising Muslim and wanted to provide a service that would allow Muslims to find a marriage partner in a way that was compatible with Islamic values. His concern was that for many Muslims, the only way to meet a marriage partner was through family contacts or intermediaries, a process which many Muslims found awkward and outdated. Whilst websites were being used by and were becoming more popular with some Muslims, many other Muslims disapproved of them, and in particular, of the more “mainstream Western” websites because they were perceived to allow or promote casual relationships rather than focussing on finding a marriage partner. Meanwhile, the only website then specifically targeted at the Muslim market was, in Mr Younas’ view, of very poor quality.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_43"><span class="judgment-body__number">43.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As a result of this, Mr Younas decided to set up Muzmatch to provide Muslims with the opportunity to find marriage partners using the more modern means of a website but one which specifically sought to be compatible with Islamic values. To this end, he created a pay as you go<sup>6</sup> website with features designed to weed out users who were not serious in their search for a Muslim marriage partner. This was reflected in that website’s homepage from 2011 which stated that the Muzmatch website:  </p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">“… <i>is the UK’s leading website helping you to find your perfect Muslim marriage partner!

However, Muzmatch’s focus continued to be to provide a service, targeted at Muslims, to find a marriage partner and its app is described on the Apple App Store as “<i>Muzmatch: Single Muslim dating; Halal, Arab &amp; Muslim marriage</i>” and on the Google App Store as “<i>Muzmatch: Muslim &amp; Arab Singles, Marriage &amp; Dating”</i>.

In view of what I have said above, I cannot see any basis for this suggestion. Moreover, in order to ensure that Muzmatch’s services are consistent with Islamic values, the Muzmatch app has the following features:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">a.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">All users are required to confirm their ethnicity, sect, religiosity, frequency of praying,<sup>7</sup> marital status and marital plans.

In the course of this, someone (probably Mr Craig, but possibly Mr Younas himself) suggested “muzmatch” would be an appropriate name for the matchmaking services that Mr Younas was thinking of providing to the Muslim community. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_49"><span class="judgment-body__number">49.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Craig stated that he didn’t recall knowing at the time of Match as he was recently married and dating services were “<i>not on my radar</i>”. Mr Craig was stated that the group from Morgan Stanley had not discussed other existing dating sites on the market and had not carried out any research into names. In cross examination, Mr Austen sought to suggest that Mr Craig must have been aware of Match. However, I see no reason to doubt Mr Craig’s evidence. Mr Younas’ evidence was that he had heard of Match (as well as various other dating websites such as eHarmony, JDate, Shaadi, Jeevansathi, Bharat Matrimony and Single Muslim) and he was aware of it as a mainstream dating website. He said, however, that he was not thinking about Match when he chose “muzmatch” because, in his mind, the word “match” in this context described the service being provided (matchmaking) and linking it to the letters “muz” showed that those services were being directed at Muslims. Mr Younas liked the name because it carried a clear and simple message (a service that helped users find a Muslim match). In effect, the name “<i>says on the tin what the service is for</i>” and was catchy and memorable. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_50"><span class="judgment-body__number">50.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Despite that evidence, the pages that I have seen from Muzmatch’s website (certainly those from 2011), do not use the word “match” (or even variants such as “matchmaking”) descriptively but instead refer to the service as being the means to find “<i>your perfect Muslim partner</i>”. The business card used by Muzmatch to promote its services in that period had that same statement on its front whilst, on its reverse, were the words “<i>Halal alternative to find your spouse”. </i>That continued to be how Muzmatch described its services throughout, although I note that Muzmatch’s app, launched in March 2015, does feature a page which states “<i>it’s a muzmatch</i>” when notifying a user that its search has found a potential partner. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_51"><span class="judgment-body__number">51.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Younas also gave evidence that he had no intention of suggesting any connection between Muzmatch and Match and, indeed, that any such suggestion would have been damaging given the taboo in the Muslim community surrounding the use of mainstream dating websites.

Muzmatch, such as the variants that appeared on the front and the back of the business cards mentioned above. These were the same as logo 2 above but without the letters “BETA” and, on the front, with the letters “.com” added in white text. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">b.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Secondly, Match does not make any claim as regards the logos which do not include the word “muzmatch”.

During this period, the Muzmatch name or logo was used not only on Muzmatch’s website but also in its marketing and promotional materials – being predominantly organic social media content, word of mouth, leaflets and, in particular, on the business card mentioned above which Mr Younas says was handed out at mosques and at Muslim events.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_56"><span class="judgment-body__number">56.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">After the switch to the app in March 2015, Muzmatch appears to have grown more rapidly. Whilst it had had 7,824 signups in the UK in March 2016, generating some 25.8m online swipes, by September 2021, those figures had grown to 666,069 signups and an average of 71m swipes a month. In this period, the name was used not only on the app itself but also in organic and (largely after 2017) in paid-for social media content promoting the app. These included two advertisements featuring a play on the words from well-known songs by Lionel Ritchie <i>“Halal! Is it me you’re looking for” </i>(which reached over 100,000 people in the UK in February 2018) and Adele <i>“Halal from the other side!”</i>. The same advertisements also appeared on the London Underground and on public buses in London and Manchester. Mr Younas also gave evidence of television advertisements since 2018 on the Islam Channel and Sky TV and, from there, on Muzmatch’s YouTube page.</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><b><i>Muzmatch’s Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) activities</i></b></p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_57"><span class="judgment-body__number">57.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">An important part of the case related to Muzmatch’s SEO activities in the period from January 2012 to January 2020. Mr Younas’ evidence was that, in around January 2012, he put in place an SEO strategy copied from that used by the SingleMuslim.com dating website. He explained that the strategy involved making a list of some 5000 words or word combinations (referred to as “keywords”) that related in some way to Muslim marriage or Muslim matchmaking. A page, known as a landing page, was then created on the Muzmatch website for each of these keywords. These landing pages would be indexed by search engines, such as Google, so that a user who carried out a search using one of those keywords would be presented with search results which included a link which, if clicked on, took the user to the relevant landing page on Muzmatch’s website. Muzmatch accepts that the aim of its SEO strategy was to promote and increase visits to its website.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_58"><span class="judgment-body__number">58.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Mr Younas’ evidence was that the list of keywords that he adopted in January 2012 was copied from the SingleMuslim.com list (albeit that he scanned through it to ensure that there was nothing that was offensive or an obvious outlier). Although the word “match” was not of itself a keyword, there were some 132 keywords that contained that word, including, for example, “match-muslim”, “muslimmatch”, “muslim-match” and “UK-muslim-match” with, sometimes, a country reference (e.g. Afghanistan or Albania, etc.). However, Mr Younas’ evidence (which I accept) was that in creating his list of keywords, he did not think about Match.com or the Match Group. He pointed out that if he had wished to mislead people or to suggest that Muzmatch was a Muslim version of the Match brand, he would have included “match.com” in the list, but he had not done that. I will return to this point later, but it is noteworthy that the list of keywords does include keywords such as Singlemuslim, Shaadi, SimplyMarry, Salaam Love and Asian Flames, which are the names of other dating or introduction websites.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_59"><span class="judgment-body__number">59.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In around March 2015, Mr Younas revisited the list of keywords to include keywords more related to mobile apps such as “muslim-app” and “muslim-mobile”. It does not appear that Mr Younas added any more keywords containing the word “match”. However, he did add “muslim-tinder”, “tinder” and “halal-tinder” as keywords. The word “tinder” was clearly not a word relating to or describing Muslim marriage or Muslim matchmaking. Indeed, as set out above, Muzmatch now accepts the use of such keywords infringed Match’s trade marks in the Tinder Marks. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_60"><span class="judgment-body__number">60.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The following is an example of a landing page for a search using the keyword “UK Muslim Match”. As can be seen, that search term is set out prominently at the top of the landing page and is then repeated three times in the subsequent text. Although this particular page was dated 4 October 2018, it is probable that it would have been in substantially the same form in 2012. Certainly, Mr Younas does not suggest that he had altered the wording of the landing pages. </p></div></section><section><p><img src="https://judgment-images.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/ewhc/ipec/2022/941/image28.png" style="width:288.73pt;height:137.07pt"></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_61"><span class="judgment-body__number">61.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It is not clear exactly how many users, having carried out a search on the keywords in issue, would have clicked through to these landing pages. As Mr Austen pointed out, this data was available to Muzmatch (but not to Match) using the Google Analytics tool but it was not produced. In the absence of Google Analytics data, Match relied on a report from its own SEO agency (Clustaar) for the period starting in January 2017 and ending 25 September 2021. This report contained data obtained by use of the SEMRUSH tool. It shows the actual position (or ranking) that various links to Muzmatch’s website achieved when a search was carried out using the keywords in issue. Then, on the basis of that ranking, the report provided estimates of the volume of searches that would have been carried out in order to achieve that ranking and of how many of those searches would have resulted in the searcher clicking through to the relevant landing page on Muzmatch’s website. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_62"><span class="judgment-body__number">62.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The report concluded that there had been some 32,770 searches carried out in respect of the URLs “muzmatch.com/”, “muzmatch.com/single-muslim-marriage-uk-muslim-match” and “muzmatch.com/single-muslim-marriage-muslim-match-making” and that these led to a total of 11,725 click throughs to the relevant landing pages on Muzmatch’s website. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_63"><span class="judgment-body__number">63.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Whilst these figures are estimates, they are based on the actual ranking of the links to the Muzmatch website as they appeared in the search results. In my judgment, they show that there were a substantial number of searches on keywords that included the word “match” and that a reasonably substantial number of users clicked through from that link to the landing pages on the Muzmatch website. Given that achieving such click throughs was the entire purpose of the SEO strategy that Muzmatch operated for almost 10 years and given the absence of any evidence from Muzmatch on this issue, I see no reason not to accept these figures.</p></div></section><section><p><b><u>Settlement discussions and Match’s acquisition of Harmonica</u></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_64"><span class="judgment-body__number">64.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It appears that Match learned of Muzmatch’s activities in around January 2016. On 26 January 2016, its representatives wrote to Muzmatch asserting that those activities infringed the 1996 Match.com Mark and the Match Device Mark (amongst other marks) and amounted to passing off. This led to without prejudice settlement discussions where the parties sought to agree terms on which, subject to an agreement on branding style, Muzmatch could continue to use the Muzmatch name. However, these discussions broke down in late 2016. Subsequently, from September 2017, the parties were involved in negotiations as to whether Match could buy Muzmatch. In the course of these negotiations, Match made four separate offers, all of which were rejected by Mr Younas and these negotiations ended in January 2019. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_65"><span class="judgment-body__number">65.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As I understand it, Muzmatch’s case is not that these events gave rise to any estoppel but rather that they showed a degree of tolerance of its activities and that this is relevant to explaining its state of mind in continuing to use the Muzmatch name. I will return to this later. However, whatever the position during those discussions, by 2018, Match’s objection to Muzmatch’s use of the Muzmatch name was clear from its oppositions to applications made by Muzmatch to register that name as an EU and a UK trade mark. Those oppositions, based on the grounds that use of that name would give rise to a likelihood of confusion and would take unfair advantage of the reputation of the Match Marks, succeeded in the EU Intellectual Property Office’s Opposition Division on 19 January 2018 and in its Board of Appeal on 25 September 2018 and also in the UK Intellectual Property Office on 12 February 2020.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_66"><span class="judgment-body__number">66.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On 7 August 2019, Match made a public announcement that it had:</p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>“… made an acquisition of Cairo-based Harmonica, an app which approaches mobile matchmaking with respect for local traditions and cultures.

Mr Younas argues that the fact that Match sought to buy Muzmatch and then acquired Harmonica shows that Match did not cater for the Muslim community. He also points out that when Match re-branded the Harmonica business, it chose not to use the “Match” name, but instead called it “Hawaya”. I will return to these points later in this judgment. In April 2020 the Hawaya app was launched in the UK and is described in the Apple App Store as a “<i>Muslim Marriage App</i>”. The action against Muzmatch was commenced by Claim Form issued on 30 July 2020.</p></div></section><section><p><b><u>The trade mark claims</u></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_68"><span class="judgment-body__number">68.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Match’s claim is that Muzmatch has used signs (“the Muzmatch Signs”) which infringe the Match Marks under s.10(2)(b) and/or s.10(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 and also, in the case of the two European trade marks (the 1996 Match.com Mark and the 2017 Match.com Mark) for the period before the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, infringe those Marks under Articles 9(2)(b) and/or 9(2)(c) of the EU Trade Mark Regulation. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_69"><span class="judgment-body__number">69.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The Muzmatch Signs for these purposes are those of the logos shown in paragraph 53 above that include “match” (as part of the word Muzmatch) and the keywords featuring the word “match” that were used by Muzmatch as part of its SEO activities as set out in paragraph 58 above.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_70"><span class="judgment-body__number">70.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Regarding the Match Marks, only one of these predated the time in April or May 2011 when Muzmatch started trading.

Nor do I accept Ms Bowhill’s submission in closing that <i>“the market for Muslim dating is a discrete and distinct one”</i>, if by that she meant that no Muslim would use Match’s services.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_75"><span class="judgment-body__number">75.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In the first place, I do not think that it is possible to put all practising Muslims into a single category and to say that they are “<i>not the typical user of dating services</i>”. To do so assumes a uniformity of views that does not exist. Mr Younas himself gave evidence regarding the huge diversity of views within Islam and this is reflected in the fact that Muzmatch itself asks users whether they are “very practising”, “moderately practising”, “practising” or “non-practising” Muslims and whether they “never”, “sometimes”, “usually” or “always” pray. Whilst it may be that some practising Muslims will not use dating services (indeed, as mentioned above, there seems to be a reasonably substantial number of Muslims who object even to Muzmatch’s Islamic-focused dating services on the basis that it is “haram”), other practising Muslims (as well as some non-practising Muslims) will use them. Further, whilst it is correct that (before its 2020 launch of Hawaya) Match had not specifically targeted the Muslim community, Mr Riviere’s evidence (which I accept) was that, in 2018 and 2019, Match had a reasonably large number of new registrants who identified themselves as Muslims when registering for its services. Although Match did not have records for the earlier years, I can see no reason why the position would have been any different then. Secondly, whilst it is true that Match’s services were not specifically targeted at Muslims, the fact is that they were not specifically targeted at <i>any</i> particular class or type of person (other than someone who is looking for a partner). The targeting of its services could reach (and in Mr Younas’ case clearly did reach) Muslims as well as non-Muslims. Accordingly, I find that the average consumer might be of any race, creed, age, sex or background.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_76"><span class="judgment-body__number">76.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to the characteristics of the average consumer, it was common ground that the average consumer is someone who is reasonably well informed, reasonably circumspect and observant, albeit someone who rarely has the chance to make a direct comparison between the marks in issue and so has to run the risk of imperfect recollection.

Further, there is a clear oral similarity in that the average consumer is likely to emphasise the “match” part when enunciating the Match Marks and is likely to give the muz/muslim/UK element and the “match” element equal emphasis when enunciating the Muzmatch Signs (in effect reading them almost as separate words - “Muz Match” or “UK Muslim Match”). I also find that there is a clear conceptual similarity. The average consumer would perceive that the word “match” was being used as a brand, but would also see that it was a reference to the nature of the services (to find a match). Conceptually, the addition of “muz” or “muslim” or “UK” would be seen as merely restricting that same concept somewhat (to find a Muslim match in the UK). </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">b.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>“.com” </i>– this was a feature of Match’s two Match.com Marks but not of Muzmatch’s Signs (with the exception of logo 1 and of the sign on the business card to which I have referred). However, this does not prevent a clear visual and aural similarity arising from the common use of the word “match”. Further, I do not think that any great conceptual difference arises from the presence or absence of the “.com” element. The average consumer, whilst taking note of this element, is likely to take it to be a reference to the fact that the services are provided online and, therefore, to focus more on the “match” element of the mark.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">c.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Font/case </i>– there are some differences between the font and case used for Muzmatch’s Signs and those used for the Match Marks.

Such devices would have no effect at all when the marks are being referred to orally. Visually and conceptually, the average consumer would notice the presence of the heart. However, given the nature of the services (to find a partner), the very simple way in which the heart was depicted, and the role of imperfect recollection, I do not think that the presence of the heart (or its absence) would significantly affect the assessment of similarity that the average consumer would make based on the common use of the word “match”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">e.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>Butterfly device </i>– as mentioned above, the butterfly device was added to Muzmatch’s Signs in 2016.

For example, there is a slightly higher degree of similarity in the case of logo 2 (because the word “match” is emphasised by being in a different colour to that used for the “muz” element) and logos 7 and 8 (because they do not feature the heart or the butterfly device).

Consistently with this, the evidence shows that, by April or May 2011, many people were referring to the business simply as “Match”, as can be seen from the branding and tracking reports, the responses of some people to the TOM awareness question posed for those reports and some of Match’s advertisements to which I have referred. Indeed, by 2011 Match was itself emphasising the “Match” element of its Mark (see paragraph 23 above). Another example of this can be seen on the page from the Match.com website dated 26 May 2010 which stated: “<i>Are you looking for matchaffinity.com? A different kind of relationship service from match</i>”. Whilst this is referring to Match Affinity, it is a page from the main Match.com website referring to another service available from Match and, more importantly for present purposes, referring to itself simply as “match”.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">c.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In these circumstances, the average consumer, certainly by early 2011, would have been well aware that the word “match” in the context of on line dating services was capable of being used and was being used both descriptively and distinctively (the example I put to Mr Austen in argument being “<i>I met my perfect match on Match</i>”). The average consumer would be perfectly able to distinguish between such uses and would have been in no doubt that, in the context of the Match.com Marks, it was being used in a distinctive sense rather than descriptively. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">d.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Muzmatch produced evidence of third parties using the word “match” in relation to dating services. In many of these instances, the word was plainly being used descriptively. In others, it was part of the name of the service provider but, with two exceptions, there is no evidence that these service providers were trading in 2011. The exceptions were “Senior Match” and “Millionaire Match”. The 2021 Google Play descriptions of the apps for these entities quote prices in pounds sterling and state that they started trading before 2011. However, this is all that I know about them. I know nothing about the scale of their operations and, in particular, whether they were operating in the UK under those names as at 2011 (I note that the “developer” was, in both cases, said to be in California). Mr Lubot’s evidence was that Match had been active in opposing or obtaining limitations of around 180 third party applications for trade marks that included the word “match” but none pre-dated 2011 and only 7 were from 2011 (Match being successful in each of these cases in preventing registration of the word “match” for dating services). It appears, therefore, that use of “match” in a distinctive sense was not widespread in around April 2011, save by Match.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">e.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On this basis, I am satisfied that by early 2011 the average consumer would have associated distinctive uses of the word “match” in the context of on-line dating services with the services of Match, the Claimants. In my judgment, this would have been the case when the average consumer looked at the 1996 Match.com Mark and also, from its 13 January 2017 filing date, at the 2017 Match.com Mark, and also at the Match Device Mark when it started to be used in 2015. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">f.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In relation to the Muzmatch logos, it is again clear that the word “match” was being used as part of the business name – i.e. in a distinctive rather than descriptive sense.

For example, a search on “UK Muslim Match” may have been intended to find a match who was a Muslim in the UK. However, that same search may also have been made if the keyword was used being distinctively – by someone looking for a Muslim partner on Match. Indeed, the fact that such use could be distinctive is implicit in Muzmatch’s admission of liability with regard to its use of Tinder as an SEO keyword. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">i.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">On this basis, an average consumer carrying out a search using a keyword that included the word “match”, may well have been looking for Match and its services. However, as Ms Bowhill submits, the mere fact that Muzmatch used the word “match” as part of a keyword is not, of itself, actionable. Rather, as appears from <i>Interflora Inc. v Marks &amp; Spencer plc </i>[2014] EWCA Civ 1403 at [155], the issue is whether what was produced as a result of a search carried out using that keyword was such that an average user could not have ascertained (or could only have ascertained with difficulty) whether what was produced originated from Match (or an undertaking economically connected with Match) or from a third party. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">j.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In this regard, as Ms Bowhill points out, there is no evidence of what the search results themselves (i.e. the link) would have looked like when a user carried out a search using one of the relevant keywords. On this basis, she argues that the court is unable to determine whether those search results satisfied the <i>Interflora </i>test. In my judgment, it is likely that the results would have shown a link to the Muzmatch website and, therefore, to have featured the “muzmatch” name. If so, the average consumer would not have been able to ascertain (and certainly not without difficulty) that that link did not originate from Match (or an undertaking economically connected with Match) but, rather, from a third party. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">k.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Even if I am wrong as regards the link, it is common ground that a user who clicked on that link would have been taken to the relevant landing page on the Muzmatch website. In such event, as appears from paragraph 60 above, a user who had searched on “UK Muslim Match” would have been taken to a landing page that used that search term in its title and in a further three places, including in the phrase <i>“if you are looking for Uk Muslim Match then you have come to the right place.…”.</i> The absence of the letter “a” before “Uk Muslim Match”, the capitalisation used in the above phrase, and the wording of this landing page as a whole, is more consistent with distinctive use than with descriptive use. In my judgment, it was liable to lead a user to believe that the landing page was connected with Match. Whilst the website itself was the Muzmatch website, I am satisfied for the reasons set out above that would not have dispelled the confusion and would not have made it clear to the user that the services on that website were actually being offered by a third party with no connection to Match. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">l.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Finally, by reason of the matters set out in paragraphs 61-63 above, I find that a relatively substantial numbers of users would have seen the link and the relevant landing pages on the Muzmatch website (respectively, 32,770 and 11,725) and are likely to have been confused as a result.</p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_94"><span class="judgment-body__number">94.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Taking the evidence as a whole and, in particular, the evidence of Match’s dominant presence in the market as at 2011 (and continuing thereafter), I find that the use of the Muzmatch Signs was likely to lead the average consumer in this case to conclude that Muzmatch was connected in some material way with the business that used the Match.com Marks and, after 3 March 2015, with the business that used the Match Device Mark. In particular, I find that the average consumer would have thought that Muzmatch was a sub-brand of that business specifically targeted at Muslim users and particularly at those Muslim users who felt that the services of a mainstream on-line dating service provider were not in accordance with Islamic values.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_95"><span class="judgment-body__number">95.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In reaching this conclusion, I have taken into account the point made by Ms Bowhill that Muzmatch has been trading since 2011 and that, despite hugely extensive searches by the parties for the purposes of disclosure,<sup>10</sup> Match has only been able to find three instances of what it says (but Muzmatch denies) was confusion.

Where services are provided to a customer in that manner, then any other dealings with that customer are likely to be conducted via that same website or app and are likely to relate to the services that that customer had received via that website or app. On this basis, as Hildyard J noted in <i>Fine &amp; Country </i>at [84]-[86] (see above), it is hard to see how or why any confusion that there might be in the customer’s mind would come to light. It would rarely be relevant to the customer’s issues – and that this is so even for those customers who use (as Ms Bowhill submitted was possible) two or three different on-line dating platforms. Given this, it seems to me that, despite the longer period of trading involved, this case falls squarely within the scope of what Mann J said in <i>Specsavers </i>as set out above. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_100"><span class="judgment-body__number">100.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In arguing that confusion would have come to light, Ms Bowhill pointed to Mr Younas’s evidence that Muzmatch had been contacted by customers of Minder (another provider of dating services) in relation to matters concerning Minder’s services. The difficulty with this is that I know nothing about Minder and its services, save that Mr Younas has said that it had copied a number of app features and it looked similar to the Muzmatch app. Otherwise, I have no evidence as to how Minder operated and I do not think that this evidence helps me in considering the likelihood of confusion arising from two businesses like Match and Muzmatch that are using similar names. </p><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number"></span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top"><i>The evidence of actual confusion </i></p></div></section></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_101"><span class="judgment-body__number">101.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As mentioned above, Match seeks to rely on three instances of what it says is relevant confusion.

As Ms Bowhill points out, on its face, this may not be evidence of relevant confusion given that the person concerned claimed not to be a user of any dating websites. However, the fact that someone had contacted Match with a complaint regarding Muzmatch is evidence of some sort of a likelihood of confusion arising from the similarity in the names, although in the absence of more details, it is difficult to place too much reliance on this particular instance.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_103"><span class="judgment-body__number">103.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The second instance is in a website chat in July 2018.

By using the name “muzmatch” in a way that created a link to the Match.com Marks (and particularly to do so in relation to identical or, at least, highly similar goods or services), Muzmatch was, in effect, taking some of the benefit of that reputation and of that investment and was doing so without paying for it.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_122"><span class="judgment-body__number">122.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">The case is less clear as regards the Match Device Mark given that that Mark in itself had no enhanced distinctiveness as at its relevant date of 3 March 2015.

As I understand it, Mr Younas’ state of mind was based on his belief that the word “match” was descriptive. In my judgment, for the reasons I have already set out, whatever Mr Younas’ subjective intention or belief, the average consumer (including some who were Muslims) would not have seen the relevant use of the word “match” by either Match or Muzmatch as being descriptive and would instead have made a link between the Muzmatch Signs and the Match Marks.

Tinder’s services, being more clearly focussed on forming casual relationships, are likely to be more objectionable to traditional Islamic values than Match’s services. Yet Muzmatch was perfectly prepared to use the Tinder name. Indeed, in addition to its use as part of an SEO keyword, I have seen marketing material from Muzmatch describing itself as “<i>Way more than just a ‘Muslim tinder</i>” and interviews given by Mr Younas in which he said “<i>I took what was good from Tinder</i>”. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_126"><span class="judgment-body__number">126.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In arguing that it had not intended to take unfair advantage, Muzmatch also placed some reliance on the fact that, after 2016, there had been discussions between Match and Muzmatch (see paragraph 64 above). I cannot see how this assists Muzmatch. The negotiations started with Match’s letter alleging that Muzmatch’s actions infringed the Match Marks and that was still Match’s position in 2018 when it successfully opposed Muzmatch’s applications to register the Muzmatch name as a trade mark (see paragraph 65 above). Muzmatch may have hoped that the negotiations would lead to a favourable result that would allow it to continue using the Muzmatch name, but I cannot see how this could convert the unfair advantage that Muzmatch had taken of the Match Marks into a fair advantage.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_127"><span class="judgment-body__number">127.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For these reasons, I also reject Ms Bowhill’s argument that Match’s decision to rebrand Harmonica as Hawaya (rather than as a sub-brand of Match) shows that there could be no benefit to Muzmatch in creating a link in people’s minds with Match. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_128"><span class="judgment-body__number">128.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">An argument raised by Mr Austen was that the conclusion that Muzmatch had taken unfair advantage of the distinctive character or repute of the Match Marks was supported by the style and colours which Muzmatch used for its branding.

As set out above, Mr Younas admits that he was aware of Match and I can see that it is likely that he kept Match’s branding in mind. However, I am not convinced that this provides Match with much real assistance. As appears from <i>Planetart </i>at [38], the concept of unfair advantage under s.10(3) does not seek to prevent a business learning from its competitors, even to the extent of (to use the words of Mr Alexander Q.C. in <i>Planetart</i>) “adopting similarities in approach and presentation”. On the facts, I do not think that the evidence shows a general tendency by Muzmatch to follow or to ape Match’s branding beyond its use of the Match name. Mr Younas gave detailed evidence of how Muzmatch’s branding was chosen and evolved and, in the context of on-line dating services, I do not regard it as particularly significant that there are similarities in the use of lower case lettering, or of a heart device, or that Muzmatch (for a very short time in respect of an app to be used on smaller mobile devices) used the single letter “M” with a heart device.

In the case of a mark composed of a number of elements, the court should consider whether those interests should reasonably permit the use of all of those elements in combination, not merely some of them. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">43</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Second, the approach should not be so strict that it is only where a defendant proves that there is no practical alternative at all to the use of the sign in question that a defendant's sign would be regarded as being used with due cause. There has to be some degree of latitude, which will depend on the circumstances of the trade. However, it must be borne in mind that this provision only comes into play after it has been found that there is not only a link between the registered trade mark and the sign but also that it has taken unfair advantage or is detrimental to the distinctive character of the trade mark in the sense that the case law has required. That does raise the bar for a defendant to show that the use of the sign is nonetheless with due cause.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">44</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Thirdly, where the registered mark includes descriptive elements (or other elements which are less likely to have trade mark significance—such as a colour or design) and the case for application of s.10(3) is largely based on the common use of such elements, the easier will it be for a defendant to show that the use of those elements is with due cause. That approach gives effect to the purpose of the law articulated in <i>Leidesplein</i> and <i>Argos</i>.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__nested-section"><span class="judgment-body__number">45</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Fourthly, cases are highly fact dependent but the court should seek a proportionate response.

Save for this, the concept is not something that is, expressly at least, recognised in any UK or European trade mark legislation.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_138"><span class="judgment-body__number">138.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Despite this, as explained in cases such as <i>Budějovický Budvar, národní podnik v Anheuser-Busch, Inc </i>C- 482/09, [2009] EWCA Civ 1022 and [2012] EWCA Civ 880 and <i>IPC v Media 10 </i>[2014] EWCA Civ 1439, the concept reflects the fact that where two parties have been trading for a sufficiently long period using the same mark, that mark may have come to indicate the goods or services of either of those parties. In effect, the mark may no longer fulfil (as least as between those parties) the essential function of a trade mark: namely acting as a badge of origin for the goods or services of just one of them. In such a case, a party may be entitled to register the mark notwithstanding that the other party had also used the mark (as in <i>Budweiser</i>) or it may be able to defend an infringement claim brought by that other party (as in <i>IPC v Media 10</i>). Further, it is clear from cases such as <i>Victoria Plumb Ltd v Victorian Plumbing Ltd </i>[2016] EWHC 2911 that the concept can apply not just where the marks used by the parties were identical but also where they were similar and, therefore, can apply to infringement cases brought under s.10(2) and 10(3) of the Trade Marks Act 1994 as well as to those brought under s.10(1). In such infringement cases, it is not that honest concurrent user is a specific defence; rather, it is that where there has been honest concurrent use, the conditions for infringement are unlikely to be satisfied (see the suggestion made by Arnold J, in relation to s.10(2), in <i>W3 Ltd v Easygroup Ltd </i>[2018] EWHC 7 at [287]). </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_139"><span class="judgment-body__number">139.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As explained by Jacob LJ in <i>Budweiser</i>, where the concept operates, its effect is that the parties must live with such confusion as is inevitable given their long period of concurrent use although, as explained by Henry Carr J in <i>Victoria Plumb </i>at [74] and [79]<i>,</i> neither party should do anything to exacerbate the confusion beyond that which is inevitable. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_140"><span class="judgment-body__number">140.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">Ms Bowhill argues that the present case is a strong case of honest concurrent use.

I do not accept this argument. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_141"><span class="judgment-body__number">141.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In cases like <i>Budweiser</i> and the other honest concurrent user cases relied on by Ms Bowhill, the use relied on as being honest concurrent use seems not to have been infringing use when it started. Indeed, in each of them, the claimant’s mark sued on was registered after (usually well after) the honest concurrent user had started. In contrast, in the present case, Muzmatch’s use started as infringing use of Match’s prior registered Mark; that use had interfered with the essential function of that Mark, had given rise to a likelihood of confusion and/or had taken unfair advantage of the reputation of that Mark. Moreover, given the 26<sup>th</sup> January 2016 letter and Match’s (successful) opposition to the registration of the Muzmatch name as an EU and a UK trade mark (see paragraphs 64-65 above), Muzmatch was well aware that Match regarded the Muzmatch Signs as infringing. In the absence of, say, estoppel or statutory acquiescence, it is difficult to see how use that starts as infringing use can be turned into honest use by the fact that it has continued. The very reason why use infringes is because, if left unchecked, its effect would be to educate the public that the mark does not indicate the services of the trade mark proprietor. It must be a very unusual case where (again, in the absence of estoppel or statutory acquiescence) a defendant can argue that continuing to infringe gives rise to a defence to an infringement claim. I do not think that this is such a case and, in my judgment, Muzmatch’s use cannot be regarded as honest concurrent use. Whilst I accept that Mr Younas did not intend to create a link to or confusion with the Match Marks (because he wrongly saw use of the word “match” as descriptive in this context and because he was serving only the Muslim community), I do not see that this can give rise to a defence when, objectively viewed, his actions infringed Match’s rights for the reasons set out above. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_142"><span class="judgment-body__number">142.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">It seems to me that Ms Bowhill’s argument is really seeking to take the concept of honest concurrent user into the sphere of acquiescence or estoppel or even of limitation (none of which features in the list of issues for this case). There is an element of this in Ms Bowhill’s submission that Mr Younas relied on representations made by Match during the settlement discussions to the effect that their concern was not use of the name Muzmatch per se, but rather, the format and style used. Ms Bowhill (rightly, in view of the matters mentioned in the previous paragraph) does not argue that this gives rise to any estoppel but simply relies on it to support her claim that Muzmatch was acting honestly. However, I cannot see that this assists Muzmatch.

I find that by 2011, the 1996 Match.com Mark had acquired a substantial goodwill and that that goodwill also attached to the 2017 Match.com Mark as from its filing date of 13 January 2017. I also find that significant goodwill would have attached to the Match Device Mark soon after its filing date of 3 March 2015 given the use that was then made of it (as evidenced in, for example, the March 2016 branding report). I am also satisfied that, by 2011, Match had also acquired significant goodwill in the word “match” by itself, when used distinctively (i.e. as part of a brand) in relation to online dating services in that, by that time, such use would have been seen as indicating that the relevant goods or services emanated from the Claimants, Match. Finally, I am also satisfied that, whilst Match’s services were not specifically targeted at people in the Muslim community, its goodwill in the Match Marks and in the word Match extended into that community (see paragraphs 75 and 110 above).</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_145"><span class="judgment-body__number">145.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As to misrepresentation, for the reasons set out above in relation to the issue of a likelihood of confusion (see paragraphs 93–104 above), I am satisfied that the use of the Muzmatch Signs did constitute misrepresentations in that they would have led some consumers to assume that the goods and services offered by Muzmatch were somehow connected with or derived from Match. In my judgment, given the likelihood of confusion, damage would be caused to Match’s goodwill.</p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_146"><span class="judgment-body__number">146.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For the reasons I have already given, it does not seem to me that Muzmatch can raise a defence based on the concept of honest concurrent use. Accordingly, in my judgment, Match’s passing off claim succeeds.</p></div></section><section><p><b><u>Conclusion </u></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_147"><span class="judgment-body__number">147.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">For these reasons, I find that Muzmatch, by its use of the Muzmatch Signs, has infringed Match’s Marks and/or that such use amounts to passing off.</p></div></section><section><p><b><u>Post script – suitability of IPEC</u></b></p></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_148"><span class="judgment-body__number">148.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">As is apparent from the length of this judgment and from the volume of evidence and other material before the court, this case was not the simple or straightforward case that the parties suggested. I do not mean this as a criticism of the quality of the parties’ advocacy or trial preparation (which were very high). However, I do not think that the case was suitable to be heard as a two day trial in the IPEC. In particular, with counsel being limited to a half day each for their oral submissions, I have been very reliant on their written submissions and did not have the benefit of hearing full oral submissions on various matters of factual or legal difficulty. This inevitably made writing this judgment a far lengthier and more difficult task. </p></div></section><section class="judgment-body__section" id="para_149"><span class="judgment-body__number">149.</span><div><p class="judgment-body__text judgment-body__no-margin-top">In my view, if the parties wished this case to be heard as a two day trial in the IPEC, they should have attempted to narrow the issues in the lead up to the CMC and, if that was not possible or if the scale of the issues only later became apparent, one or both of them should have sought to have the case transferred into the main High Court list to allow for it to have a longer trial. In this regard, from the evidence before me, it does not seem that this was the sort of case where either party needed the special IPEC procedures and, in particular, its cost capping rules, to help them obtain access to justice. Both appear to have fought this case as if it was normal High Court litigation.</p></div></section></section><footer><hr><div><p><sup>1</sup>  Since the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, this mark is now protected in the UK as a comparable trade mark (EU), No.UK00900182253 </p></div><div><p><sup>2</sup>  Now protected in the UK as a comparable trade mark (EU), No.UK00916246639</p></div><div><p><sup>3</sup>  e.g. “<i>1.6 million people in the UK met their partner on Match</i>” or “<i>Hi, I’m your Match coach.
